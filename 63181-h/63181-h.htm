<h1>A JAPANESE NIGHTINGALE</h1>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>I<br/>
THE STORM DANCE</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> last rays of sunset were tingeing
the land, lingering in splendor above
the bay. The waters had caught the
golden glow, and, miser-like, seemingly made
effort to keep it with them;
but, inexorably, the lowering sun drew
away its gilding light, leaving the
waters a dark green. The shadows
began to darken, faint stars peeped out
of the heavens, and slowly, unwillingly,
the day&#146;s last ray followed the sunken
sun to rest; and with its vanishment
a pale moon stole overhead and threw
a seraphic light over all things.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>[pg&nbsp;2]</span>
Out in the bay that the sun had left
was a tiny island, and on this a Japanese
business man, who must also
have been an artist, had built a tea-house
and laid out a garden. Such
an island! In the sorcerous moonlight,
one might easily believe it the
witch-work of an Oriental Merlin.
Running in every direction were narrow
jinrikisha roads, which crossed
bewildering little creeks, spanned by
entrancing bridges. These were round
and high, and curved in the centre,
and clinging vines and creeping,
nameless flowers crawled up the sides
and twined about the tiny steps which
ascended to the bridges. After crossing
a bridge shaped thus, a straight bridge
is forever an outrage to the eye and
sense. And all along the beach of this
island was pure white sand, which
looked weirdly whiter where the moonbeams
loitered and played hide-and-seek
under the tree-shadows.</p>

<p class="indent">The seekers of pleasure who made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>[pg&nbsp;3]</span>
their way out to the little island on
this night moored their boats here
in the shadows beneath the trees,
and drove in fairy vehicles, pulled
by picturesque runners, clear around
the island, under the pine-trees, over
miniature brooks, into the mysterious
dark of a forest. Suddenly they were
in a blaze of swinging, dazzling lights,
laughter and music, chatter, the clattering
of dishes, the twang  of the samisen,
the ron-ton-ton of the biwa. They
had reached the garden and the tea-house.</p>

<p class="indent">Some pleasure-loving Japanese were
giving a banquet in honor of the full
moon, and the moon, just over their
heads, clothed in glorious raiment,
and sitting on a sky-throne of luminous
silver, was attending the banquet
in person, surrounded by myriad
twinkling stars, who played at being
her courtiers. Each of the guests
had his own little mat, table, and waitress.
They sat in a semicircle, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>[pg&nbsp;4]</span>
drank the sake hot, in tiny cups that
went thirty or more to the pint; or the
Kyoto beer that had been ordered for
the foreigners who were the chief
guests this evening. This is the toast
the Japanese made to the moon:
&#147;May she with us drink a cup of immortality!&#148;
and then each wished the
one nearest him ten thousand years
of joy.</p>

<p class="indent">Now the moon-path widened on the
bay, and the moon itself expanded and
grew more luminous as though in
proud sympathy and understanding
of the thousand banquets held in her
honor this night. All the music and
noise and clatter and revel had gradually
ceased, and for a time an eloquent
silence was everywhere. Huge
glowing fire-flies, flitting back and
forth like tiny twinkling stars, seemed
to be the only things stirring.</p>

<p class="indent">Some one snuffed the candles in the
lanterns, and threw a large mat in the
centre of the garden, and dusted it extravagantly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[pg&nbsp;5]</span>
with rice flour. Then a
shaft of light, that might have been
the combination of a thousand moonbeams,
was flashed on the mat from
an opening in the upper part of the
house, and out of the shadows sprang
on to the mat a wild, vivid little figure,
clad in scintillating robes that reflected
every ray of light thrown on them;
and, with her coming, the air was
filled with the weird, wholly fascinating
music of the koto and samisen.</p>

<p class="indent">She pirouetted around on the tips
of the toes of one little foot, clapped
her hands, and courtesied to the four
corners of the earth. Her dance was
one of the body rather than of the feet,
as back and forth she swerved. There
was a patter, patter, patter. Her garments
seemed endowed with life, and
took on a sorrowing appearance; the
lights changed to accompany her;
the music sobbed and quivered. It had
begun to rain! <i>She</i> was raining! It
seemed almost as if the pitter-patter of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>[pg&nbsp;6]</span>
her feet were the falling of tiny raindrops;
the sadness of her garments
had increased, and now they seemed
to be weeping, at first gradually, then
faster and still faster, until finally
she was a storm&mdash;a dark, blowing,
lightning storm. From above the light
shot down in quick, sharp flashes, the
drums clashed madly, the koto wept on,
and the samisen shrieked vindictively.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly the storm quieted down
and ceased. A blue light flung itself
against the now lightly swaying
figure; then the seven colors of the
spectrum flashed on her at once. She
spread her garments wide; they fluttered
about her in a large half-circle,
and, underneath the rainbow of the
gown, a girl&#146;s face, of exquisite beauty,
smiled and drooped. Then the extinction
of light&mdash;and she was gone.</p>

<p class="indent">A common cry of admiration and
wonder broke out from Japanese and
foreigners alike. They called for her,
clapped, stamped, whistled, cheered.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[pg&nbsp;7]</span>
One man&#146;s voice rose above the clatter
of noises that had broken loose all over
the gardens. He was demanding excitedly
of the proprietor to tell him
who she was.</p>

<p class="indent">The proprietor, smirking and bowing
and cringing, nevertheless would
not tell.</p>

<p class="indent">The American theatrical manager
lost his head a moment. He could make
that girl&#146;s fortune in America! He
understood it was possible to purchase
a geisha for a certain term of years.
He stood ready on the spot to do this.
He was ready to offer a good price for
her. Who was she, and where did she
live?</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile the nerve-scraping dzin,
dzin, dzin of a samisen was disturbing
the air with teasing persistence.
There is something provoking and
still alluring in the music of the samisen.
It startles the chills in the blood
like the maddening scraping of a piece
of metal against stone, and still there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[pg&nbsp;8]</span>
is an indescribable fascination and
beauty about it. Now as it scratched
and squealed intermittently and gradually
twittered down to a zoom, zoom,
zoom, a voice rose softly, and gently,
insinuatingly, it entered into the music
of the samisen. Only one long note
had broken loose, which neither trembled
nor wavered. When it had ended
none could say, only that it had passed
into other notes as strangely beautiful,
and a girl was singing.</p>

<p class="indent">Again the light flashed down and
showed her standing on the same mat
on which she had danced, her hands
clasped, her face raised. She was
ethereal, divinely so. Her kimono was
all white, save where the shaft of moonbeams
touched the silk to silvery brilliance.
And her voice! All the notes
were minors, piercing, sweet, melancholy&mdash;terribly
beautiful. She was
singing music unheard in any land
save the Orient, and now for the first
time, perhaps, appreciated by the foreigners,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg&nbsp;9]</span>
because of that voice&mdash;a voice
meant for just such a medley of melody.
And when she had ceased, the last note
had not died out, did not fall, but remained
raised, unfinished, giving to
the Occidental ears a sense of incompleteness.
Her audience leaned forward,
peering into the darkness, waiting
for the end.</p>

<p class="indent">The American theatrical manager
stalked towards the light, which lingered
a moment, and died out, as if
by magic, as he reached it. But the
girl was gone.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;By Jove! She&#146;s great!&#148; he cried
out, enthusiastically. Then he turned
on the proprietor. &#147;Where is she?
Where can I find her?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">The man shook his head.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Oh, come, now,&#148; the American demanded,
impatiently, &#147;I&#146;ll pay you.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I don&#146; know. She is gone.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;But you know where she lives?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">The proprietor again answered in
the negative.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg&nbsp;10]</span>
&#147;Now, wouldn&#146;t that make one of
this country&#146;s squatty little gods
groan?&#148; the exasperated manager demanded
of a younger man who had
followed him forward.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;She&#146;d be a great card in vaudeville,&#148;
the young man contented himself
with saying.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;There&#146;s a fortune in her! I&#146;m going
to find her if she&#146;s on this island.
Come on with me, will you?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Nothing loath, Jack Bigelow fared
forth behind the theatrical man, whom
he had never seen before that afternoon,
and whom he never expected to
see again. They hurried down one
of the narrow, shadowy roads that
almost made a labyrinth of the island.
But fortune was with them. A turn
in the road, which showed the waters
of the bay not fifty yards ahead, revealed
just in front of them two figures&mdash;two
women&mdash;both small, but one a
trifle taller than her companion.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Hi there! You!&#148; shouted the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg&nbsp;11]</span>
manager, who, though among a people
whose civilization was older than his
own, considered them but heathen,
and gave them the scant courtesy deserved
by all so benighted in matters
theatrical. The two figures suddenly
stopped.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Are you the girl who sang?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Yes,&#148; came the answer in a clear
voice from the taller figure.</p>

<p class="indent">The manager was not slow in coming
to the point.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Would you like to be rich?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Again the positive monosyllable, uttered
with much eagerness.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Good!&#148; The manager&#146;s face could
not be seen, but his satisfaction was
revealed in his voice. &#147;Just come with
me to America, and your fortune&#146;s
made!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">She stood silent, her head down,
so that the manager prompted her
impatiently: &#147;Well?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I stay ad Japan,&#148; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Stay at Japan!&#148; The manager
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg&nbsp;12]</span>
barely controlled himself. &#147;Why, you
can never get rich in this land. Now
look-a-here&mdash;I&#146;ll call and see you to-morrow.
Where do you live?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I don&#146; want you call. I stay ad
Japan.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">This time the manager, seeing a
possible fortune escaping him, and
having in mind the courtesy due the
heathen, delivered himself of a large
Christian oath. &#147;If you stay here,
you&#146;re a fool. You&#146;ll never&mdash;&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">The young man named Bigelow,
who had watched the attempted bargaining
in silence, broke in with some
indignation. &#147;Oh, let her go! She&#146;s
got a right to do as she pleases, you
know. Don&#146;t try to bully her into
going to America if she&#146;d rather stay
here.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Well, I suppose I can&#146;t use force to
make her take a good thing,&#148; said
the manager, ungraciously. He drew
out his card-case and handed the girl
his card. &#147;Perhaps you&#146;ll change
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg&nbsp;13]</span>
your mind after you think about this
a bit. If you do, my name and Tokyo
address are on that card; just come
round and see me. I&#146;m going down
to Bombay to look out for some Indian
jugglers. I&#146;ll be gone about five
months, and will be back in Tokyo
before I start out on another trip to
China, Corea, and the Philippines,
and then off for home.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">The girl took the card and listened
in silence; when he finished, she courtesied,
slipped a hand into that of her
companion, and hurried down the narrow
road.</p>

<p class="indent">After the two Americans had made
their way back to the tea-garden, the
older one at once sought out the proprietor.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You know something about that
girl. Come, tell us,&#148; he said, imperiously.</p>

<p class="indent">The proprietor was profusely courteous,
but hesitated to speak of the
one who had danced and sung. Finally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg&nbsp;14]</span>
he unbent grudgingly. He told
the theatrical man and his companion
that he knew next to nothing about
her. She had come to him a stranger,
and had offered her services. She
refused to enter into the usual contract
demanded of most geishas, and in
view of her talents he could not afford
to lose her. She was attracting large
crowds to his gardens by her strange
dances. Still he disliked and mistrusted her.
She came only when it
suited her whim, and on <i>f&#234;tes</i> and occasions
of this kind he had no means
of knowing where she was. It was
only by accident she had happened
in this evening. Once he had attempted
to follow her, but she had discovered him,
and made him promise never
to do such a thing again, threatening
to stay away altogether if he did so.
He spoke disparagingly of her:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Beautiful, excellencies! Phow! You
cannot see properly in the deceitful
light of this honorable moon. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg&nbsp;15]</span>
cheap girl of Tokyo, with the blue-glass
eyes of the barbarian, the yellow
skin of the lower Japanese, the hair
of mixed color, black and red, the form
of a Japanese courtesan, and the heart
and nature of those honorably unreliable
creatures, alien at this country,
alien at your honorable country,
augustly despicable&mdash;a half-caste!&#148;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>II<br/>
IN WHICH WOMAN PROPOSES AND<br/>
MAN DISPOSES</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Jack Bigelow</span> was beset by the
nakodas (professional match-makers).
He was known to be one of the richest
foreigners in the city, and the nakodas
gave him no rest. Though he found
them interesting, with the little comedies
and tragedies to relate of the
matches they had made and unmade,
he had remained impregnable to their
arts. He naturally shrank from such
a union, and in this position he was
strengthened by a promise he had
made before leaving America to a college
chum, his most intimate friend,
a young English-Japanese student,
named Taro Burton, that during his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg&nbsp;17]</span>
stay in Japan he would not append
his name to the long list of foreigners
who for a short, happy, and convenient
season cheerfully take unto themselves
Japanese wives, and with the same
cheerfulness desert them.</p>

<p class="indent">Taro Burton was almost a monomaniac
on this subject, and denounced
both the foreigners who took to themselves
and deserted Japanese wives,
and the native Japanese, who made
such a practice possible. He himself
was a half-caste, being the product
of a marriage between an Englishman
and a Japanese woman.
In this case, however, the husband
had proved faithful to his wife and
children up to death; but then he had
married a daughter of the nobility,
a descendant of the proud Jokichi
family, and the ceremony had been
performed by an English missionary.
Despite the happiness of this marriage,
Taro held that the Eurasian was born
to a sorrowful lot, and was bitterly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg&nbsp;18]</span>
opposed to the union of the women
of his country with men of other lands,
particularly as he was Westernized
enough to appreciate how lightly such
marriages were held by the foreigners.
It was true, of course, that after the
desertion the wife was divorced, according
to the law, but that, in Taro&#146;s
mind, only made the matter more detestable.</p>

<p class="indent">For five years, up to their graduation
four months before this, the young
American and the young half-Japanese
had been associated as closely together
as it is possible for two young men to
be, and a strong and deep affection
existed between them.</p>

<p class="indent">It had been originally decided that
the friends would make this trip together,
which in Taro Burton&#146;s case
was to be his return to the home he
had left, and, with Jack Bigelow, was
to be the beginning of a year&#146;s travel
preliminary to entering the business
of his father, who was a rich shipbuilder.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg&nbsp;19]</span>
But for some reason, which
he never clearly set forth to his friend,
Taro had backed out at almost the
last minute; yet he had urged Jack to
undertake the trip alone, and, under
promise to follow shortly, finally had
prevailed. So Jack Bigelow had made
the long voyage to Japan, and had
taken a pretty house of his own a short
distance from Tokyo.</p>

<p class="indent">It was unfortunate that Taro could
not have accompanied his friend, for,
while the latter was not a weak character,
he was easy-going, good-natured,
and easily manipulated through his
feelings.</p>

<p class="indent">The young Japanese, had he done
nothing else, at least would have kept
the nakodas and their offerings of
matrimonial happiness on the other
side of the American&#146;s doors. As it
was, one of them in particular was so
picturesque in appearance, quaint in
speech, and persistent in his calls, that
the young man had encouraged his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg&nbsp;20]</span>
visits, until a certain jocular intimacy
put their relations with each other on
a pleasant and familiar footing.</p>

<p class="indent">It was this nakoda (Ido was his name,
so he told Jack) who brought an applicant
for a husband to his house, one
day, and besought him at least to hold
a look-at meeting with her.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;She is beautiful like unto the sun-goddess,&#148;
he declared, with the extravagance
of his class.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;The last was like the moon,&#148; said
the young man, laughing. &#147;Have
you any stars to trot out?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Stars!&#148; echoed the other, for a
moment puzzled, and then, beaming
with delighted enlightenment, &#147;Ah,
yes&mdash;her eyes, her feet, hair, hands,
twinkling like unto them same stars!
She prays for just a look-at meeting
with your excellency.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Well, for the fun of the thing,
then,&#148; said the other, laughing. &#147;I&#146;m
sure I don&#146;t mind having a look-at
meeting with a pretty girl. Show
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span>
her into the zashishi (guest-room)
and I&#146;ll be along in a moment. But,
look here,&#148; he continued, &#147;you&#146;d better
understand that I&#146;m only going
through this ceremony for the fun of
the thing, mind you. I don&#146;t intend
to marry any one&mdash;at all events, not a
girl of that class.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Nod for a leetle while whicheven?&#148;
persuaded the nakoda.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Nod for a leetle while whicheven,&#148;
echoed the young man, but the agent
had disappeared.</p>

<p class="indent">When Jack, curious to know what
she was like, she who was seeking
him for a husband, entered the zashishi,
he found the blinds high up and the
sunshine pouring into the room. His
eyes fell upon her at once, for the
shoji at the back of the room was parted,
and she stood in the opening, her head
drooping bewitchingly. He could not
see her face. She was quite small,
though not so small as the average
Japanese woman, and the two little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg&nbsp;22]</span>
hands, clasped before her, were the
whitest, most irresistible and perfect
hands he had ever seen. He had heard
of the beauty of the hands of the
Japanese women, and was not surprised
to find even a girl of this
class&mdash;she was a geisha, of course, he told
himself&mdash;with such exquisite, delicate
hands. He knew she was holding them
so that they could be seen to advantage,
and her little affected pose amused and
pleased him.</p>

<p class="indent">After he had looked at her a moment,
she subsided to the mats and made
her prostration. She was dressed very
gayly in a red cr&#234;pe kimono, tied about
with a purple obi. Her hair was dressed
after the fashion of the geisha, with
a flower ornament at top and long,
pointed daggers at either side; but as
she bowed her head to the mats, some
pin in her hair escaped and slipped,
and then a tawny, rebellious mass
of hair, which was never meant to be
worn smoothly, had fallen all about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg&nbsp;23]</span>
her, tumbled into her eyes and over
her ears, and literally covered her little
crouching form. She shivered in shame
at the mishap, and then knelt very still
at his feet.</p>

<p class="indent">Bigelow was speechless. Never before
in his life had he seen such hair.
It was black, though not densely so,
for all over it, even where it had been
darkened with oil, there was a rich
red tinge, and it was luxuriously thick
and long and wavy.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Good heavens!&#148; he said, after the
little figure had remained absolutely
motionless for a full minute; &#147;she&#146;ll
hurt or cramp herself in that position.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">The girl did not rise at the sound
of his voice, but crept nearer to him,
her hair still enshrouding her. It
made him feel creepy, and annoyed
and pleased and amused him altogether.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Don&#146;t do that,&#148; he said. &#147;Please
stand up. Do!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">The nakoda told him to lift her to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg&nbsp;24]</span>
her feet, and the young man did so,
entangling his hands in her hair.
When she stood up, he saw her face,
which was oval and rosy, the lips very
red. She still drooped her eyes, so that
her face was incomplete.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;What&#146;s your name?&#148; he asked her,
gently. &#147;And what do you want
with me?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Now she raised her head and he
saw her eyes. They startled him.
They were large, though narrow, and
intensely, vividly blue. Before, with
her hair neatly smoothed and dressed,
he had noticed nothing extraordinary
about her; now, with that rich
red-black hair enshrouding her, and
the long, blue eyes looking at him
mistily, she was an eerie little creature
that made him marvel. A Japanese
girl with such hair and eyes! And
yet the more he looked at her the more
he saw that her clothes became her;
that she was Japanese despite the hair
and eyes. He did not try to explain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg&nbsp;25]</span>
the anomaly to himself, but he could
not doubt her nationality. There was
no other country she could belong to.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You are Japanese?&#148; he finally
asked, to make sure.</p>

<p class="indent">She nodded.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I thought so, and yet&mdash;&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">She smiled, and her eyes closed a
trifle as she did so. She was all Japanese
in a moment, and prettier than
ever.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You see&mdash;your eyes and hair&mdash;&#148; he
began again. She nodded and dimpled,
and he knew she understood.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;What is it you want with me?&#148;
he asked, desiring rather to hear her
speak than to learn her object, for
this he knew.</p>

<p class="indent">She was solemn now. She flushed,
and her eyes went down. To explain
to him why she had come to him in
this wise was a painful task. He
could guess that, but she forced the
words past her lips.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;To be your wife, my lord,&#148; she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg&nbsp;26]</span>
said in English, and the queer quality
of her voice thrilled him strangely.</p>

<p class="indent">This was the answer he knew was
coming; nevertheless it stirred him in
a way he had not expected. To have
this wonderfully pretty girl before him,
beseeching him to marry her&mdash;he who
had as yet never dreamed of marriage
for himself&mdash;was disturbing to his balance
of mind. Nay, more&mdash;it was revolting.
He shrank back involuntarily,
wondering why she had come to him,
and this wonder he put into words.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;But why do you want to marry
me?&#148; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">The expression of her face was enigmatical now.
She had ceased to blush
and smile, and had become quite white.
Suddenly she commenced to laugh&mdash;thrilling,
elfish laughter, that rang out
through the room, startling the echoes
of the house.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Why?&#148; he repeated, fascinated.</p>

<p class="indent">She shrugged her shoulders. &#147;I mus&#146;
make money,&#148; she said.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg&nbsp;27]</span>
Of course this was her reason; he
knew that before she spoke; but hearing
her say so gave him pain. She
was such a dainty little body.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Oh, you need not sell yourself for
that,&#148; he said, earnestly. &#147;Why, I&#146;ll
give you some&mdash;all you want. You&#146;re
awfully young, aren&#146;t you? Just a
little girl. <i>I</i> can&#146;t marry you. It
wouldn&#146;t be fair to you.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Again she shrugged her shoulders,
and spoke in Japanese to the nakoda.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;She says some one else will, then,&#148;
he interpreted.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;All right,&#148; said the young man,
almost bitterly.</p>

<p class="indent">She pretended to go towards the
door, and then came back towards
Bigelow.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I seen you before,&#148; she announced,
ingenuously.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Where?&#148; He was curiously interested.
He fancied that her face was
familiar.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Ad tea-house.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg&nbsp;28]</span>
&#147;What tea-house?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;On liddle bit island. You &#145;member?
I dance like this-a-way.&#148; She performed
a few steps.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;What! you that girl?&#148; He knew
her in an instant now. &#147;How could
you remember me?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You following me after dance with
&#145;nudder American gent, and before thad
some one point ad you&mdash;ole wooman
thad always accompanying me.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;How did <i>she</i> know me?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;She din know you to speag ad,
bud&mdash;she saying you mos&#146; reech barbarian
ad all Japan.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Oh, I see,&#148; he said, coldly.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;She tell me I bedder git marry
with you.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Indeed! Why?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">She hung her head a moment. &#147;Because
she know I luffing with you,&#148;
she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You loving with <i>me</i>!&#148; He laughed
outright. Her ingenuousness was entrancing.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg&nbsp;29]</span>
&#147;Yes,&#148; she said, and he, with masculine
conceit, half believed her.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;But wouldn&#146;t you rather stay at
the tea-house than get married?&#148; he
asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Not nuff money that businesses,&#148;
she returned.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Do you do everything for money?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;How I goin&#146; to live?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">This question, answering a question,
brought her back to the purpose
of her visit. She held her little hands
out to him.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Ah, excellency, <i>pray</i> marry with
me,&#148; she begged.</p>

<p class="indent">He took her hands quickly in his
own. They were soft and so small.
He could enclose them with one of his.
They were delightful. He knew they
were daintily perfumed, like everything
else about her. He did not let
them go.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You ought not to marry, you know,&#148;
he said to her, almost boyishly. &#147;How
old are you, anyhow?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg&nbsp;30]</span>
She ignored his question.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I will be true, good wife to you forever,&#148;
she said, and then swiftly corrected herself,
as though frightened
by her own words. &#147;No, no, I make
ridigulous mistage&mdash;not forever&mdash;jus&#146;
for liddle bit while&mdash;as you desire,
augustness!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;But I don&#146;t desire,&#148; he laughed
nervously. &#147;I don&#146;t want to get married.
I won&#146;t be over a few months
at most in Japan.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Oh, jus&#146; for liddle bit while marry
with me,&#148; she breathed, entreatingly&mdash;&#147;Pl-ease!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">It hurt him strangely to have her
plead so. She looked delicate and refined
and gentle. He put her hands
quickly from him. She held them
out and put them back again into his.
Her eyes clouded, and he thought she
was going to cry.</p>

<p class="indent">He was seized with a desire to keep
her from weeping, if he could, this
little creature, who seemed made for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg&nbsp;31]</span>
anything but tears. He spoke from
this impulse, without giving so much
as a second&#146;s thought to the seriousness
of his words.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Don&#146;t cry. I&#146;ll marry you, of
course, if you want me to.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">He felt the hands in his own tremble.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Thangs, excellency,&#148; she said, in
a voice that was barely above a whisper,
but it was a voice which had in
it no note of joy.</p>

<p class="indent">There was pleasure, however, in
the eyes of the nakoda. He had done
a good piece of business, a most excellent
piece of business, for the American
gentleman was reputed to be able
to buy hundreds and hundreds of rice-fields
if he so cared to do. The nakoda
came forward with a benignant smile
to arrange the terms.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;She will cost only three hundred
yen per down and fifteen yen each end
per week. Soach a cheap price for a
wife!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">It was the grinning face of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg&nbsp;32]</span>
matrimonial middleman that brought
Bigelow back to his senses. He had
said he would marry this little creature,
whose limp hands he was holding.
He dropped them as though they were
the hands of one dead, and drew back.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I won&#146;t do it!&#148; he almost shouted.
&#147;Never!&#148; Then he thought what must
be the feelings of the little girl whose
yoke of marriage he was refusing, and
softened. &#147;I wasn&#146;t thinking when
I said I would. I don&#146;t want to marry
a Japanese girl. I don&#146;t want to marry
any girl. I wouldn&#146;t be doing right,
and it wouldn&#146;t be fair to you.&#148; He
paused, and then added, lamely, &#147;I
think I&#146;d like you awfully, though, if I
only knew you.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;But&mdash;&#148; spoke up the nakoda, anxiously,
who found his dream of a large
fee fading into thin air.</p>

<p class="indent">Jack turned upon him quickly and
gave him a sharp look, whereat he
retired hurriedly.</p>

<p class="indent">A look of relief had come over the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg&nbsp;33]</span>
girl&#146;s face when Jack had cried out
that he would not marry her, and at
this he wondered much. This relief
in her face, however, was succeeded
almost instantly by disappointment.
But she spoke no further word. She
gave him a single hurried glance from
beneath fluttering eyelashes, courtesied
until her head was almost on a level
with his knees, and left him.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>III<br/>
AN APPOINTMENT</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Jack Bigelow</span> regarded the attempt
of the nakoda and little
Miss &mdash;&mdash; (he had not even thought to ask
her name) as an incident closed by the
retirement of the one aspiring to wifehood
from his sight. But in passing
from his house she had not passed
from his mind. This she occupied in
spite of him, though it must be said
that Jack made no effort to eject her.</p>

<p class="indent">He had been approached by many
nakodas, who had the disposal of
some most excellent wives, so they
had told him, but never before had he
consented to see one of their offerings;
so the sensation of being asked in marriage
by a girl whom he had only seen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg&nbsp;35]</span>
once before, and that under circumstances
which prevented his seeing
her clearly, was altogether new. That
he, John Hampden Bigelow, A.B.&mdash;he
was very proud of that A.B., it had
not cost him any particular labor&mdash;should
be so sought out was not at
all displeasing to his vanity, a quality
that he prided himself on not possessing;
this, notwithstanding the fact
that he knew he had been approached
because he had money.</p>

<p class="indent">He chuckled at the event several
times during the day. He would keep
this incident in mind, with all its detail,
and make use of it now and then
after he had returned home, when he
was called upon to talk of his experiences
in other lands. Of course, he
would exaggerate a bit here and tone
down a bit there, and would make the
girl much prettier. No, the girl was
pretty enough. This part of the incident
could not be improved upon.</p>

<p class="indent">Jack mused about the morning&#146;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg&nbsp;36]</span>
episode during the entire day, and
twice exploded into such laughter at
the idea of his being asked for a husband
that his little man hurried in
to see if the gay-eyed barbarian was
taking leave of his senses. In the
evening he grew restless, and, having
nothing else to do&mdash;so he told himself&mdash;he
went out to the tea-garden
on the little island which he had visited
a few nights before. For an hour he
waited for something&mdash;for something
that did not appear. Finally, when
the proprietor chanced to pass him,
he asked in the manner of one casually
interested:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;The girl who danced and sang
the other night&mdash;is she here?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">She was not, for which the proprietor
humbly asked pardon. She had not
visited his poor place since the night
the American had seen her.</p>

<p class="indent">For some reason Jack suddenly lost
interest in the house and gardens, and
returned to his home. But the next
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg&nbsp;37]</span>
night&mdash;again because he had nothing
else to do&mdash;found him once more a
guest at the tea-garden. This time
he did not leave at the end of an hour;
possibly because a weird dance was
performed and a weird song sung by a
girl with vivid blue eyes. He could
not see their color from where he sat,
but he knew they were blue.</p>

<p class="indent">After that he fell into the habit of
visiting the gardens every night&mdash;these
were dull times in Tokyo&mdash;never
anything else to do. Most of the evenings
so spent were intensely wearisome,
but some few of them were not.
It may only have been a series of coincidences,
but it so happened that on the
enjoyable evenings there was a weird
dance and a weird song, and on the
others there were not the graceful
swayings of a little body, nor the wonderful
music of a wonderful voice.</p>

<p class="indent">One evening, immediately after the
song had been ended, he found himself
striding down the same road he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg&nbsp;38]</span>
had taken with the excited theatrical
manager, and this without consciously
having decided upon such a course.
But he came down to the beach without
seeing man or woman, and, though
he would not acknowledge to himself
that he was seeking any one, he carried
away with him a keen sense of disappointment.</p>

<p class="indent">For two weeks the dulness of Tokyo
remained unabated, so that the evenings
offered nothing else to do save
to go to the tea-gardens. At the end
of that time, Jack, becoming honest
with himself, admitted that there was
nothing else, because there was nothing
else he wanted to do, and while
in this frank mood he let it become
known to himself that there was nothing
else in all the land of the rising
sun that held so much of interest to
him as did the girl who had offered
herself to him for wife&mdash;nothing, indeed,
in all the other lands of the earth.
Why this was, he did not know, not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg&nbsp;39]</span>
being one given to searching his own
soul or the souls of others.</p>

<p class="indent">While he reclined at his ease one
afternoon in the little room in which
he lounged and smoked, he began to
place her, in his imagination, here and
there in the house, to try the effect.</p>

<p class="indent">He set her in one of his largest chairs,
notwithstanding she would have been
much more comfortable on the floor,
in this same room, and she added wonderfully
to the appearance of things.
He stood her pensively by the tokonona;
he nodded his head&mdash;very good!
He placed her out beneath a cherry-tree
in his garden; again he nodded
approvingly. And a breakfast with
her sitting opposite him! That would
be like unto the breakfasts eaten by
the angels in heaven&mdash;if angels partake
of other than spiritual nourishment.
Yes, she would be wonderfully
effective in his little house, would
harmonize with it greatly.</p>

<p class="indent">But what an odd figure she would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg&nbsp;40]</span>
make in an American dress! He
thought of her in a golfing costume,
and smiled at his fancy. Nevertheless,
even in the gowns worn by the
women of his own country, she would
be quaint and charming, he felt sure.
She would be awkward, of course, but
would be graceful even in her awkwardness.
And she would transgress
every polite convention, and would make
herself all the more delightful in so
doing. He compared her to the wives
of some of the men he knew, to many
of the girls he had met since girls had
begun to have interest for him, and
his admiration for her grew apace. He
would be proud of her, he knew, for she
was pretty and would attract attention;
men like their wives to draw eyes
towards them. She was unlike the wife
of any of his countrymen he was likely
to meet, and this also was much.</p>

<p class="indent">What would his parents think?
They&#146;d be angry at first, of course, but
they&#146;d give in; they loved him, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg&nbsp;41]</span>
couldn&#146;t resist her; no one could resist
her. Anyhow, this prospective
trouble was so far ahead that there was
no use in wasting thought upon it now.</p>

<p class="indent">Why the deuce hadn&#146;t he learned
her name? It was very monotonous
this being compelled to think of her only
as &#147;she&#148; and &#147;her.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">But why had she come to him asking
him to marry her? He shook his head
at that; he didn&#146;t quite like it. But&mdash;oh,
well, you know, these Japs have no
end of queer customs. This incident
just illustrated one of them. She was
clearly a superior kind of a girl. Not
an ordinary geisha as he had thought
when his eyes first fell on her. He
had seen enough of the geishas at the
tea-houses to know that she was of a
different kind; to his Occidental eyes
these last were most pleasing creatures,
but&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">Just then his man straggled through
the room and brought an end to his
musing. Marry her? He sat up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg&nbsp;42]</span>
straight. What had he been thinking
about? The idea was absurd.
It was absurd for him to think about
marrying any one. He got to his feet,
called back his man, and ordered a
jinrikisha to be brought to him. He
rode off to Tokyo to forget all about it.</p>

<p class="indent">But it would not be forgotten. After
he had left the jinrikisha he caught
sight of her on the opposite side of the
street, turning a corner. He hurried
after her, but when he reached the
corner she was nowhere to be seen.
He looked into all the shops on either
side of the street for a distance of a
hundred yards, but saw no one who
bore the least resemblance to her.
Then he tramped about the immediate
vicinity, his sense of loss deepening
with each minute, until he noticed that
the shop-keepers were eying him with
suspicion. He gave up the search and
started back to his jinrikisha.</p>

<p class="indent">As he was swinging along disconsolately,
his eyes lighted upon another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg&nbsp;43]</span>
person whom he knew&mdash;Ido, the nakoda&mdash;and
him Jack did not let escape. He
pounced down upon him, and clapped a
hand upon his shoulder.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Hallo there!&#148; he called out.</p>

<p class="indent">Ido started back as if he had been
set upon by an enemy. He was unused
to such emphatic greetings. But
when he saw who his assailant was
he slipped a smile upon his face, smirked
and bowed, and hoped that the august
American&#146;s days were filled with
joy.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;They&#146;ll do,&#148; Jack answered. &#147;And
how are things with you? Business
good? Making many matches?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Ido had introduced four persons to
incomparable happiness&mdash;which was to
say, he had brought about two marriages.
Had his lordship come into
like happiness?</p>

<p class="indent">No, his lordship had not.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You making gradest mistage you&#146;
whole lifetime,&#148; Ido assured him.
&#147;You nod yit seen Japanese woman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg&nbsp;44]</span>
that please you for wife? No? I
know nodder girl you&#146; excellency nod
seen yit. Mos&#146; beautiful in Japan.
You like see her?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;No, I&#146;ve seen enough. By-the-way,
Ido, what&#146;s become of the girl
you brought around to my place?
Married yet?&#148; Jack put on a look of
indifferent interest.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;No, excellency.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">For one disinterested, Jack found
much relief in this answer.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;But I thing she going to be,&#148; Ido
went on, calmly. &#147;Two, three&mdash;no,
two odder gents&mdash;What you say?&mdash;consider&mdash;yes,
consider her.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">These words drove relief from the
disinterested Jack&#146;s heart, and instantly
set up in its place a raging
jealousy. But he compelled himself to
remark, quite easily, &#147;You don&#146;t say!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Ido confirmed his statement with a
nod that was almost a bow.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;A very pretty girl,&#148; Jack commented,
loftily.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[pg&nbsp;45]</span>
Ido&#146;s reply was confined to a mere
&#147;Yes.&#148; There was no use going into
ecstasies when no bargain was in sight.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I think I&#146;ll go around to see her,
and congratulate her,&#148; Jack went on.
&#147;Where does she live?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I regretfully cannot tell.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Ah, well, let it go then. But, say,
I really would like to see her again
before she&#146;s married. Rather took a
fancy to her, you know. Couldn&#146;t you
bring her to call on me to-morrow morning?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I going to be very busy to-morrow.&#148;
Seeing no chance of earning a marriage-fee,
he saw no reason for taking
the trip.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I&#146;ll pay you for your trouble&mdash;needn&#146;t
worry about that.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Perhaps Ido could arrange to come;
yes, now that he thought again, he
knew he could come.</p>

<p class="indent">So it was settled that he and the
girl should visit Jack at ten o&#146;clock
the next day.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>IV<br/>
IN WHICH MAN PROPOSES</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> announcement of his man that
Ido and his charge had arrived contained
no news for Jack, for he had
been watching the road from Tokyo
since nine o&#146;clock, and had seen them
while they were yet afar off. Nevertheless,
he did not enter the zashishi
until his man came to him with word
that guests from the city were awaiting
him, and then he had no definite idea
of what he intended to do.</p>

<p class="indent">She was dressed exactly as she had
been on her previous visit, and she
made obeisance almost to the floor,
in greeting him, as she then had done.
He hastened her recovery from the
deep courtesy by taking her hands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg&nbsp;47]</span>
and raising her to an upright posture.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You have come to see me again?
I am very glad to see you,&#148; he said,
with eager politeness.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Nakoda say you wish see me. Tha&#146;s
why I come.&#148; There was not a trace
of her former coquetry in her manner.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Yes, I had to send Ido after you.
I don&#146;t suppose you would ever have
let me see you again if I had not.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">She shrugged her shoulders imperceptibly.
&#147;Me you don&#146; wish marrying
with. You send me &#145;way.
What I do?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;We could be capital friends, even
if we didn&#146;t care to marry, couldn&#146;t
we?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Frien&#146;? I don&#146; wan&#146; frien&#146;,&#148; she
returned, coldly.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;But I&#146;d like to have you for my
friend, all the same, though I&#146;m afraid
it&#146;s not possible. Ido&#148;&mdash;he hesitated&mdash;&#147;Ido
says you&#146;re going to be married,
you know.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg&nbsp;48]</span>
She inclined her head.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You&#146;re not married yet, are you?&#148;
he asked in alarm, forgetting that he
had put this same question to the
nakoda the day before.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Nod yit.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Do you&mdash;um&mdash;like him?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Which one, my lord?&#148; She looked
up at him innocently.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Oh, both of them!&#148; He was beginning
to get angry. He would find
pleasure in laying violent hands upon
the two, one at a time.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Jus&#146; liddle bit, augustness.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Better than you do me?&#148; he demanded,
jealously.</p>

<p class="indent">She shook her head decisively.
&#147;You nod so ole, an nod so&mdash;hairy-like.&#148;
She rubbed her little hands
over her face, by which he understood
that the two wore beards. They were
doubtless of his own country.</p>

<p class="indent">He hardly knew what to say next, and
the silence grew embarrassing to him.
She broke it by remarking, very quietly:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg&nbsp;49]</span>
&#147;Nakoda inform me you wan&#146; make
liddle bit talk ad me.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">He turned to the match-maker, who
was pretending deep interest in a
framed drawing on the wall. &#147;Say,
Ido, just step into the next room a
minute, will you?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">He turned back to the girl, as soon
as Ido had obeyed him, with extravagant
alacrity.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You have never even told me your
name,&#148; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Yuki.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;That means &#145;Snowflake,&#146; doesn&#146;t
it? I like it. Well now, Yuki, mayn&#146;t
I visit you at your home, before you
are married?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">He was anxious to see what her
people were like, and how she lived.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Mos&#146; poor house in all Tokyo&mdash;so liddle
bit house augustness nod lige come.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;But I don&#146;t care if it is. I want to
come anyhow. I want to see you, not
the house. Won&#146;t you tell me where
you live?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg&nbsp;50]</span>
She shook her head. &#147;No,&#148; She
said with simple directness, and then
added as an after-thought, &#147;House
too small. You altogedder too big to
enter thad liddle bit insignificant hovel.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Her answer gave him offence. He
wondered why she should dissemble,
wondered whether she was laughing at
him. A glance at her, however, and his
distrust vanished. She seemed such a
simple little body, yet he knew he did
not understand her.</p>

<p class="indent">Her eyes, which she had kept turned
downward, slowly uplifted and looked
questioningly into his own. Such
wonderful eyes! Such a simple, exquisite
face! He was suddenly suffused
with a great wave of tenderness,
and he bent low, and gently made
prisoners of her hands. However indefinite
his purpose had been up to
this time, it was definite enough now.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;So you remember, Yuki, what
you asked me when you were here before?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg&nbsp;51]</span>
&#147;Yes.&#148; She still gazed at him
questioningly.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Would you like to&mdash;would you
rather marry me than one of those
other fellows?&#148; he said, softly.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Yes,&#148; again, in the smallest voice
this time.</p>

<p class="indent">He hesitated, and she asked, quickly,
&#147;You <i>wan</i>&#146; me do so?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;That&#146;s just what I want, Yuki,
dear,&#148; he whispered, drawing her
hands to his lips.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;All ride.&#148; She trembled&mdash;perhaps
shivered is the better word&mdash;as she said
this, but gave no other sign of emotion.</p>

<p class="indent">Before Jack could so much as touch
his lips to her forehead, Ido entered
smiling his professional blessing. It
was evident that in the other room
he had found no drawing to distract
his attention, and a large new peephole
in the immaculate shoji indicated
where he had given all his eyes and
ears to what was going on, and he
could wait no longer to press his claim.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg&nbsp;52]</span>
Jack, seeing an unpleasant duty
before him, and desiring to have done
with it at once, told Yuki that he would
be back in a minute, and led the nakoda
into the room out of which he had just
come.</p>

<p class="indent">Ido immediately began to make
terms. This part was loathsome to
the young man.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Why,&#148; he said, hotly, &#147;if we&#146;re to
be married, she can have all she wants
and needs.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">That wouldn&#146;t do at all, the nakoda
told him, warily. There would have
to be a marriage settlement and a stated
allowance agreed upon. He would
have to pay more, also, as she was a
maid and not a widow.</p>

<p class="indent">When the ugly terms of the agreement
were completed, the nakoda bowed
himself out, and Jack went back to
Yuki. He found her changed; her simplicity
had left her, and her coquetry
had returned. She stood off from
him, and he felt constrained and awkward.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg&nbsp;53]</span>
After a time she demanded of
him, with a shrewd inflection in her
voice:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You goin&#146; to lige me, excellency?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;No question of that,&#148; he answered
promptly, smiling.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;No,&#148; she repeated, &#147;tha&#146;s sure
thing,&#148; and then she laughed at her
own assurance, and she was so pretty
he wanted to kiss her, but she backed
from him in mock alarm.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Tha&#146;s nod ride,&#148; she declared, &#147;till
we marry.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;God speed the day!&#148; he said, with
devout joyousness. Still approaching
her, as she backed from him, he questioned
her boyishly:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;And you? Will you like me?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">She surveyed him critically. Then
she nodded emphatically. They laughed
together this time, but when he approached
her she grew fearful. He did
not want to frighten her.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You god nod anudder wife?&#148; she
asked.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg&nbsp;54]</span>
&#147;No! Good heavens!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I god nod anudder hosban&#146;,&#148; she
informed him, complacently.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I should hope not.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Perhaps,&#148; she said, &#147;you marrying
with girl in Japan thad god marry
before. Me? I <i>never</i>.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;No, of course not.&#148; He didn&#146;t
quite understand what she was driving
at.</p>

<p class="indent">Then she said: &#147;You pay more
money ad liddle girl lige me whad nod
been marry before?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">He recoiled and frowned heavily
at her.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I settled that matter with the
nakoda,&#148; he said, coldly.</p>

<p class="indent">Seeing he was displeased, she tried
to conciliate him. She smiled at him,
engagingly, coaxingly.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You don&#146; lige me any more whicheven.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">But his face did not clear up. She
had hurt him deeply by her reference
to money.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg&nbsp;55]</span>
&#147;Perhaps you don&#146; want me even,&#148;
she suggested, tentatively. &#147;I bedder
go &#145;way. Leave you all &#145;lone.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">She turned and was making her
way slowly out of the room, when he
sprang impetuously after her.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Don&#146;t, Yuki!&#148; he cried, and caught
her eagerly in his arms. She yielded
herself to his embrace, though she
was trembling like a little frightened
child. For the first time he kissed her.</p>
<hr />

<p class="indent">After she had left him, he stared with
some wonder at the reflection of himself
in a mirror. So he was to be married,
was he? Yes, there was no getting
out of it now. As for that, he
didn&#146;t want to get out of it&mdash;of this
he was quite sure. He was very well
content&mdash;nay, he was enthusiastically
happy with what the future promised.</p>

<p class="indent">But his happiness might have been
felt in less measure if his eyes, instead
of staring at his mirrored likeness,
could have been fixed on Yuki.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg&nbsp;56]</span>
She had borne herself with a joyous
air to the jinrikisha, but once within
it, and practically secure from observation,
the life had seemingly gone out
of her. The brown of her skin had
paled to gray, and all the way to Tokyo
her eyes shifted neither to right nor
left, but stared straight ahead into
nothingness, and once, when Ido looked
down, he found that they were filled
with tears.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>V<br/>
IN WHICH THE EAST AND THE<br/>
WEST ARE UNITED</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">A few</span> days later they were married.
It was a very quiet little tea-drinking
ceremony, and, unlike the usual Japanese
wedding, there was not the painful
crowd of relatives and friends attendant.
In fact, no one was present, besides
themselves, save Jack&#146;s man and
maid and the nakoda, while Yuki herself
sang the marriage song.</p>

<p class="indent">They started housekeeping in an
ideal spot. Their house, a bit of art
in itself, was built on the crest of a
small hill. On all sides sloped and
leaned green highlands, rich in foliage
and warm in color. Beyond these
smaller hillocks towered the jagged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg&nbsp;58]</span>
background of mountain-peaks, with
the halo of the skies bathing them in
an eternal glow. A lazy, babbling
little stream dipped and threaded its
way between the hillocks, mirroring
on its shining surface the beauty of
the neighboring hills and the inimitable
landscapes pictured on the canvas
of God&mdash;the skies&mdash;and seeming like a
twisted rainbow of ever-changing and
brilliant colors. But no surges disturbed
its waters, even far beyond
where it emptied into the mellow Bay
of Tokyo.</p>

<p class="indent">From their elevation on the hill they
could see below them the beautiful
city of Tokyo, with its many-colored
lights and intricate maze of streets.
And all about them the hills, the meadows,
the valleys and forests bore eloquent
testimony to the labor of the
Color Queen.</p>

<p class="indent">Pink, white, and blushy-red twigs
of cherry and plum blossoms, idly
swaying, flung out their suave fragrance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg&nbsp;59]</span>
on the flattered breeze, the
volatile handmaid of young May, who
had freed all the imprisoned perfumes,
unhindered by the cynic snarl of the
jealous winter, and with silent, pursuasive
wooing had taught the dewy-tinctured
air to please all living nostrils.
So from the glowing and thrilling
thoughts that tremble on the young
tree of life is love distilled and, unmindful
of the assembling of the baffled
powers of cold caution and warning
fear, the heart is filled with fountain
tumults it cannot dissemble.</p>

<p class="indent">Jack Bigelow was fascinated and
bewildered at the turn events had taken.
He was very good and gentle to her,
and for several days after the ceremony
she seemed quite happy and contented.
Then she disappeared, and for
a week he saw nothing of her.</p>

<p class="indent">He greatly missed her&mdash;his little
bride of three or four days. He longed
ardently for her return, and her absence
alarmed him. Her little arts and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg&nbsp;60]</span>
witcheries had grown on him even in
this short period of their acquaintance.</p>

<p class="indent">Towards the end of the week she
slipped into the house quietly, and
went about her household duties as
though nothing unusual had occurred.
She did not offer to tell him where she
had been, and he felt strangely unwilling
to force her confidence.</p>

<p class="indent">Instead of becoming better acquainted
with her, each day found him more puzzled
and less capable of knowing or understanding
her. Now she was clinging,
artless, confiding, and again
shrewd and elfish. Now she was
laughing and singing and dancing
as giddily as a little child, and again
he could have sworn she had been
weeping, though she would deny it
stoutly, and pooh-pooh and laugh
away such an idea.</p>

<p class="indent">He asked her one day how she would
like to be dressed in American clothes.
She mimicked him. She mimicked
everything and every one, from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[pg&nbsp;61]</span>
warbling of the birds to the little man
and maid who waited on them.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I loog lige this,&#148; she said, and
humped a bustle under her ridiculously
tight omeshi, and slipped his large
sun hat over her face. Then she
laughed out at him, and flung her
arms tightly about his neck.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You wan&#146; me be American girl?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You are a witch, Yuki-san,&#148; he
said.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I wan&#146; new dress,&#148; she returned,
promptly, and held a pink little palm
out. He frowned. He almost disliked
her when she spoke of money. He
filled her hands, however, with change
from his pockets, and when she broke
away from him, which she did as soon
as she had obtained the money, he
wanted to take it back. Her pretty
laughter sifted out to him through the
shoji at the other side, and he knew
she was mocking him again.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;It is her natural love of dress and
finery,&#148; he told himself. &#147;It is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg&nbsp;62]</span>
eternal feminine in her, and it is bewitching.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">The next day, as she sat opposite
to him, eating her infinitesimal bit
of a breakfast&mdash;a plum, a small fish,
and a tiny cup of tea&mdash;all on a little
black lacquer tray, he announced mysteriously
that he was going &#147;on business&#148;
to the city.</p>

<p class="indent">She desired to accompany him, as
became a dutiful wife.</p>

<p class="indent">No, he told her, that was impossible.
His mission was of a secret nature,
which could not be divulged until his
return.</p>

<p class="indent">Then she insisted that she would
follow behind him after the manner of
a slave; and when he laughed at her,
she begged quite humbly and gently
that he would condescend to honorably
permit her to go with him, and
then he was for telling her his whole
pretty story, and the surprise he had
concocted to please her, when she grew
capricious and insisted that she would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg&nbsp;63]</span>
not stir one little bit of an inch from
the house, and that he must go all
alone to the city and attend to his great,
magnificent business!</p>

<p class="indent">He went down to Tokyo, and in his
boyish, blundering fashion he purchased
silk and cr&#233;pe and linen sufficient
for fifty gowns for her.</p>

<p class="indent">She thanked him extravagantly.
She could not imagine what she would
do with so much finery. Her honorable
person was augustly insignificant,
and could not accommodate so much
merchandise.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Now,&#148; he thought with inward satisfaction,
&#147;that ghost of a money question
will be laid. She has everything
she wants and shall have. I want to
do for her, and give her things without
being wheedled into it. It is that
which irritates me.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">But a few days later she came to
him breathless and flustered. Lo!
some one had stolen all the beautiful
goods he had bought her. It was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg&nbsp;64]</span>
neither their man nor maid. No, no!
that was altogether impossible. They
were honest, simple folk, who feared
the gods. But they were all quite
gone&mdash;where she could not say. Who
had taken them, she could not guess.
Perhaps she, her unworthy self, and
he, his honorable augustness, had
been extremely wicked in their former
state, and the gods were now punishing
them in their present life. It would
be wicked and unavailing to attempt
to search for the missing goods. It
was the will of the gods. Maybe the
gods had been offended at such ruthless
extravagance. Ah, yes, that was
a better solution of the theft. Of course
the gods were angry. What gods
would not be? It was sinful to buy
so many things at once.</p>

<p class="indent">She affected great distress over the
loss, and her husband, somewhat bewildered
at her elaborate apologies
for the thief who had stolen them, tried
to comfort her by saying he would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg&nbsp;65]</span>
buy her double the quantity again,
whereat she became very solemn.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;No, no,&#148; she said. &#147;Bedder give
me money to buy. I will purchase
jus&#146; liddle bit each time&mdash;to please
the gods.&#148;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>VI<br/>
THE ADVENTURESS</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> man in the hammock was not
asleep, for in spite of the lazy, lounging
attitude, and the hat which hid the
gray eyes beneath, he was very much
awake, and keenly interested in a certain
small individual who was sitting
on a mat a short distance removed from
him. He had invited her several times
to reduce that distance, but up to the
present she had paid no heed to his
suggestions. She was amusing herself
by blowing and squeezing between
her lower lip and teeth the berry of
the winter cherry, from which she
had deftly extracted the pulp at the
stem. She continued this strange occupation
in obstinate indifference to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg&nbsp;67]</span>
the persuasive voice from the hammock.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I say, Yuki, there&#146;s room for two in
this hammock. Had it made on purpose.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">She continued her cherry-blowing
without so much as making a reply,
though one of her blue eyes looked
at him sideways, and then solemnly
blinked.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;What&#146;s the matter, Yuki? Got the
dumps again, eh?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">No reply.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Look here, Mrs. Bigelow, I&#146;ll come
over and elope forcibly with you if
you don&#146;t obey me.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">She dimpled scornfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Ah, that&#146;s right! Smile, Yuki.
You&#146;re so pretty, so bewitching, so
irresistible when you smile.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki nodded her head coolly.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;How you lige me smiling forever?&#148;
she suggested.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;That wouldn&#146;t do,&#148; he said, grinning
at her from beneath his tipped
hat.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;That would be tiresome.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg&nbsp;68]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Tha&#146;s why I don&#146; smiling to-day.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Why?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;All yistidy I giggling.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">He shouted with laughter at her.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Move your mat here, Yuki,&#148; indicating
a spot close to his hammock.
&#147;I want to talk to you.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;My ears are&mdash;&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Too small to hear from that distance,&#148;
finished her husband. &#147;Come.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Thangs,&#148; with great dignity, &#147;I
am quide comfor&#146;ble. I don&#146; wan&#146; sit
so near you, excellency.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Why, pray?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Why? Hm! I un&#146;erstan&#146;. Tha&#146;s
because I jus&#146; your liddle bit slave.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You&#146;re my wife, you little bit
fraud.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Wife? Oh, I dunno.&#148; She pretended
to deliberate.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Then you&#146;ve tricked me into a
false marriage, madam,&#148; declared her
husband, with great wrath.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Tha&#146;s fault nakoda.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;What is?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg&nbsp;69]</span>
&#147;Thad you god me for wife, and,&#148;
slowly, &#147;servant.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Fault! Come here, servant, then.
Servants must obey.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Nod so bad master, making such
grade big noises,&#148; she laughed back
daringly. &#147;Besides, servant must sit
long way off from thad same noisy
master.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;And wife?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Oh, jus&#146; liddle bit nearer.&#148; She
edged perhaps half an inch closer to
him. &#147;Wife jus&#146; liddle bit different
from servant.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Look here, Mrs. Bigelow, you&#146;re
not living up to your end of the contract.
You swore to honor and obey&mdash;&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">She laughed mockingly.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Yes, you did, madam!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I din nod. Tha&#146;s jus&#146; ole Kirishitan
marriage.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">He sat up amazed.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;What do you know of the Christian
marriage service?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Liddle bit.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[pg&nbsp;70]</span>
&#147;Come over here, Yuki.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You like me sing ad you?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Come over here.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;How you like me danze?&mdash;liddle
bit summer danze?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Come over here. What&#146;s a summer
dance, anyhow?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">She ran lightly indoors, and was
back so soon that she seemed scarcely
to have left him. She had slipped
on a red-and-yellow flimsy kimono,
and had decked her hair and bosom
with flaming poppies.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Tha&#146;s summer sunshine,&#148; she said,
spreading her garment out on each
side with a joyous little twirl. &#147;I am
the Sun-goddess, and you?&mdash;you jus&#146;
the col&#146;, dark earth. I will descend
and warm you with my sunshine.&#148;
For a moment she stood still, her head
thrown back, her face shining, her
lips parted and smiling, showing the
straight little white teeth within. Then
she danced softly, ripplingly, back and
forth. The summer winds were sighing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[pg&nbsp;71]</span>
and laughing with her. Her face
shone out above her lightly swerving
figure, her little hands and bare arms
moved with inimitable grace.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You are a genius,&#148; he said to her,
when she had subsided, light as a
feather blown to his feet.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Tha&#146;s sure thing,&#148; she agreed,
roguishly.</p>

<p class="indent">Her assurance in herself always
tickled him immensely. He threw his
hat at her with such good aim that it
settled upon her head. She approved
his clever shot, laughed at him, and
then, pulling it over her eyes, lay down
on the mats and imitated his favorite
attitude to a nicety. He laughed uproariously.
He was in fine humor.
They had been married over a month
now, and she had not left him save
that first time. He was growing pretty
sure of her now.</p>

<p class="indent">She perceived his good-humor, and
immediately bethought herself to take
advantage. She put the rim of his hat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg&nbsp;72]</span>
between her teeth, imitated a monkey,
and crawled towards him, pretending to
beg for her performance. He stretched
his long arms out and tried to reach
her, but she was far enough off to elude
him.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You godder pay,&#148; she said, &#147;for thad
nize entertainments I giving you.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">He threw her a sen. She made a
face. &#147;That all?&#148; she said, in a dreadfully
disappointed voice, but, despite
her acting, he saw the greedy eagerness
of her eyes. All the good-humor
vanished.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Look here, Yuki,&#148; he said, with a
disagreeable glint in his eyes, &#147;you&#146;ve
had a trifle over fifty dollars this week.
I don&#146;t begrudge you money, but I&#146;ll
be hanged if I&#146;m going to have you
dragging it out of me on every occasion
and upon every excuse you can make.
You have no expenses. I can&#146;t see
what you want with so much money,
anyhow.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I godder save,&#148; said Yuki, mysteriously,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[pg&nbsp;73]</span>
struck with this brilliant excuse
for her extravagance.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;What for?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Why, same&#146;s everybody else. Some
day I nod have lods money. Whad I
goin&#146; do then? Tha&#146;s bedder save, eh?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I&#146;ve married you. I&#146;ll never let you
want for anything.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Oh, you jus&#146; marry me for liddle
bit while.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You&#146;ve a fine opinion of me, Yuki.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Yes, fine opinion of you,&#148; she repeated
after him.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;There&#146;s enough money deposited
in a bank in Tokyo to last you as long
as you live. If it&#146;s ever necessary for
me to leave you for a time, you will not
want for anything, Yuki.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;But,&#148; she said, argumentatively,
&#147;when you leaving me I henceforward
a widder. I nod marry with you
any longer. Therefore I kin nod take
your money.&#148; This last with heroic
pride.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Boo! Your qualms of conscience
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg&nbsp;74]</span>
about using my money are, to say the
least, rather extraordinary.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;When you leaving me&mdash;&#148; she commenced
again.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Why do you persist in that? I
have no idea of leaving you.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;What!&#148; She was quite frightened.
&#147;You goin&#146; stay with me forever!&#148;
There was far more fear than joy in
her voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Why not?&#148; he demanded, sharply,
watching her with keen, savage eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;My lord,&#148; she said, humbly, &#147;I
could nod hear of thad. It would be
wrong. Too grade sacrifice for you
honorable self.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">He was not sure whether she was
laughing at him or not.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You needn&#146;t be alarmed,&#148; he said,
gruffly. &#147;I&#146;m not likely to stay here
forever.&#148; He turned his back on her.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly he felt her light little hand
on his face. She was standing close
by the hammock. He was still very
angry and sulky with her. He closed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[pg&nbsp;75]</span>
his eyes and frowned. He knew just
how she was looking; knew if he glanced
at her he would relent ignominiously.
She pried his eyes gently open with
her fingers, and then kissed them, as
softly as a tiny bird might have done.
Gradually she crawled into the hammock
with him, regardless of non-assistance.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Augustness,&#148; she said, her arms
about his neck now, though she was sitting
up and leaning over him. &#147;Listen
ad me.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I&#146;m listening.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Look ad me.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">He looked, frowned, smiled, and
then kissed her. She laughed under
her breath, such a queer, triumphant,
mocking small laugh. It made him
frown again, but she kissed the frown
into a smile once more. Then she sat up.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Pray excuse me. I wan&#146; sit ad
your feet and talk ad you.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Can&#146;t you talk here?&#148; he demanded,
jealously.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg&nbsp;76]</span>
&#147;Nod so well. I gittin&#146; dazzled.
Permit me,&#148; she coaxed. He released
her grudgingly. She sat close to him
on the floor. She sighed heavily, hypocritically.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;What is it now?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Well, you know I telling you about
those moneys.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Yes,&#148; he said, wearily. &#147;Let&#146;s shut
up on this money question. I&#146;m sick
of it.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I lige make confession ad you.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Well?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I god seventeen brudders and sisters!&#148;
she said, with slow and solemn
emphasis.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;What!&#148; He almost rolled out of the
hammock in his amazement.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Seventeen!&#148; She nodded with ominous
tragedy in her face and voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Where do they live?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Alas! in so poor part of Tokyo.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;And your father and mother?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Alas! Also thad fadder an&#146; mudder
so ole lige this.&#148; She illustrated,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg&nbsp;77]</span>
bowing herself double and walking feebly
across the floor, coughing weakly.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Well?&#148; he prompted sharply.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I god take all thad money thad ole
fadder an mudder an&#146; those seventeen
liddle brudders an sisters. Tha&#146;s all
they god in all the whole worl&#146;.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;But don&#146;t any of them work?
Aren&#146;t any of them married? What&#146;s
the matter with them all?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Alas! No. All of them too young
to worg or marry, excellency.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;<i>All</i> of them too young?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Yes. Me&mdash;how ole <i>I</i> am? Oldes&#146;
of all! I am twenty-eight&mdash;no, thirty
years ole,&#148; she declared, solemnly.</p>

<p class="indent">He nearly collapsed. He knew she
was a mere child; knew, moreover,
that she was lying to him. She had
done so before.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Even if you are thirty, I fail to see
how you can have seventeen brothers
and sisters younger than yourself.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">She lost herself a moment. Then she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[pg&nbsp;78]</span>
said, triumphantly, &#147;My fadder have
two wives!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">He surveyed her in studious silence
a moment. Her attitude of trouble
and despair did not deceive him in
the slightest. Nevertheless, he wanted
to laugh outright at her, she was such
a ridiculous fraud.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Do you know what they&#146;d call you
in my country?&#148; he said, gravely.</p>

<p class="indent">She shook her head.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;An adventuress!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Ah, how <i>nize</i>!&#148; She sighed with
envious blissfulness. &#147;I wish I live ad
your country&mdash;be adventuressesses.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;How much do you want now,
Yuki?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">She pretended to calculate on his
fingers.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Twenty-five dollar,&#148; she announced.</p>

<p class="indent">He gave it to her, and she slipped
it into the bosom of her kimono. He
watched her curiously, wondering what
she did with all the money she secured
from him.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[pg&nbsp;79]</span>
All of a sudden she put this question
to him.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Sa-ay, how much it taking go ad
America?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;How much? Oh, not much. Depends
how you go. Four hundred, or
five hundred dollars, possibly.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">She groaned. &#147;How much come ad
Japan?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;The same.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">She sighed. &#147;Sa-ay, kind augustness,
I wan&#146; go ad America. Pray
give me money go there.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I&#146;ll take you some day, Yuki.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">She retreated before this offer.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Ah, thangs&mdash;yes, some day, of
course.&#148; Then, after a meditative moment:
&#147;Sa-ay, it taking more money
than thad three-four hundled dollar
whicheven?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Yes; about that much again for
incidentals&mdash;possibly more.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">She sighed hugely this time, and he
knew she was not affecting.</p>

<p class="indent">A few days later, poking among her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg&nbsp;80]</span>
pretty belongings, as he so much liked
to do&mdash;she was out in the garden gathering
flowers for their dinner-table&mdash;he
found her little jewel-box. Like
everything else she possessed, it was
daintily perfumed. At the top lay the
few pieces of jewelry he had bought for
her on different occasions when he had
taken her on trips to the city. He
lifted the top tray, and then he saw
something that startled him. It was
a roll of bank-bills. He took it out and
counted it. There was not quite one
hundred and fifty dollars. He calculated
all he had given her. It amounted
to a little over twice this sum. She
had been saving, after all! What was
her object?</p>

<p class="indent">And, his suspicions awakened by this
discovery, he searched uneasily further
through her apartments, and discovered,
rolled like a huge piece of carpet and
covered over by a large basket, the
cr&#233;pe and silks she had protested were
stolen.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>VII<br/>
MY WIFE!</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> second time his wife left him,
Jack Bigelow was very wretched. He
missed her exceedingly, though he
would not have admitted it, for he was
also very angry with her.</p>

<p class="indent">When she had gone away that first
time, so soon after their marriage, he
had not felt her absence as he did now,
for then she had not become a necessity
to him. But she had lived with him
now two whole months, and had become
a part of his life. She was not a mere
passing fancy, and he knew it was
folly to endeavor so to convince himself,
as in his resentment at her treatment
he was trying to do.</p>

<p class="indent">The house was desolate without her.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[pg&nbsp;82]</span>
Everywhere there were evidences of his
little girl. Here a pair of her tiny
sandals, some piece of tawdry kanzashi
for her hair, her koto, samisen,
and little drum; in the zashishi, in her
own little room, and all over the house
lingered the faint odor of her favorite
perfume, so subtle it made the young
man weak.</p>

<p class="indent">He grew to hate the silence of the
rooms. Their household had always
been small, with just a man and maid
to wait on them; and now only one
presence gone from it, and yet how
painfully quiet the place had grown!
He realized what all her little movements
had become to him. He stayed
out-doors as much as he could, only to
return restlessly to the house, with a
faint hope that perhaps she was hiding
somewhere in it, and playing some
prank on him, as she was fond of doing,
bursting out from some unexpected
place of hiding. But there was no
trace of her anywhere; and when the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[pg&nbsp;83]</span>
second day actually passed, the realization
that she was indeed gone forced
itself home to him, leaving him stupid
with rage and despair.</p>

<p class="indent">He was bitterly angry with her. She
had no right to leave him like this,
without a word of explanation. How
was he to know where she had gone
or what might happen to her? And
the thought of anything dire really
overtaking her nearly drove him distracted.
He hung around the balconies
of the house, wandered down
into the garden, and strayed restlessly
about. And all the time he knew he
was waiting for her, and in the waiting
doubling his misery.</p>

<p class="indent">She came back in four days, slipped
into the house noiselessly and ran up
to her room. He heard her, knew she had
returned, but checked his first impulse
to go to her, and threw himself back on a
couch, where he assumed a careless attitude,
which he relentlessly changed to
a stern, unapproachable, forbidding one.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg&nbsp;84]</span>
Suddenly he heard her voice. It
came floating down the stairs, every
weird minor note thrilling, mocking,
fascinating him. &#147;Toko-ton-yare ron-ton-ton!&#148;
she sang. Then the voice
ceased a moment. She was waiting
for him to call her. He did not move.
He was certainly very angry with her.
He would not forgive her readily.</p>

<p class="indent">She began beating on her drum.
He heard her making a great noise in
the little room up-stairs, and understood
her object. She was trying to attract
him. Suddenly she whirled down the
stairs and burst in on him with a merry
peal of laughter.</p>

<p class="indent">He ignored her sternly. She ceased
her noise and laughter, and, approaching him,
studied him with her head
tilted bewitchingly on one side.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You angery ad me, excellency?&#148;
she inquired with solicitude.</p>

<p class="indent">No reply.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You very <i>mad</i> ad me, augustness?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Still no reply.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg&nbsp;85]</span>
&#147;You very <i>cross</i> ad me, my lord?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Jack regarded her in contemptuous
silence.</p>

<p class="indent">She shouted now, a high, mocking,
joyous note in her laughter.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Hah! You very, very, very, very
<i>affended</i>, Mister Bigelow?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;It seems to please you, apparently,&#148;
said Jack, scathingly, wasting his sarcasm,
and turning his eyes from her.</p>

<p class="indent">She laughed wickedly.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Ah, tha&#146;s so nize.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;What is?&#148; he demanded, sharply.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Thad you loog so angery. My!
You loog like grade big&mdash;whad you
call thad?&mdash;toranadodo.&#148; She knew
how to pronounce &#147;tornado,&#148; but she
wanted to make him laugh. She failed
in her purpose, however. She tried another
way.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;<i>How</i> you change!&#148; She sighed
with beatific delight.</p>

<p class="indent">Jack growled.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Dear me! I thing you grown more
nize-loogin,&#148; she said.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[pg&nbsp;86]</span>
Jack got up and walked across to
the window, turning his back deliberately
on her, and whistling with
forced gayety, his hands in his pockets.
She approached him with feigned
timidity and stood at his elbow.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You glad see me bag, excellency?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;No!&#148; shortly.</p>

<p class="indent">This emphatic answer frightened her.
She was not so sure of herself, after
all.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You wan&#146; me go &#145;way?&#148; she asked,
in the smallest voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Yes.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">She loitered only a moment, and
then &#147;Ah-bah&#148; (good-bye) she said
softly.</p>

<p class="indent">He felt, for he would not turn around
to see, that she was crossing the room
slowly, reluctantly. He heard the
shoji pushed aside, and then shut to.
He was alone! He sprang forward
and called her name aloud. She came
running back to him and plunged into
his arms. He held her close, almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg&nbsp;87]</span>
fiercely. The anger was all gone.
His face was white and drawn. The
dread of losing her again had overpowered
him. When she tried to extricate
herself from his arms, he would
not let her go. He sat down on one
of the chairs, and held her on his knee.
She was laughing now, laughing and
pouting at his white face.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;My crashes!&#148; she cried. &#147;You loog
lige ole Chinese priest ad the temple.&#148;
She pulled a long face, and drew her
pretty eyes up high with her finger
tips; then she chanted some solemn
words, mocking mirthfully her ancestors&#146;
religion.</p>

<p class="indent">But her husband was grave. He
had not the heart to find mirth even
in her naughtiness.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Yuki,&#148; he said, &#147;you must be serious
for a moment and listen to me.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I listenin&#146;, Mr. Solemn-Angery-Patch!&#148;
She meant &#147;Cross-patch.&#148;
&#147;You loog lige&mdash;&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Where did you go?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg&nbsp;88]</span>
&#147;Oh, jus&#146; liddle bit visit.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Where did you go?&#148; he repeated,
insistently.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Sa-ay, I forgitting.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Answer me.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">She pretended to think, and then suddenly
to remember, sighing hypocritically
the while.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I lige forgitting,&#148; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Forgetting what?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Where I been.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Why?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Tha&#146;s so sad. Alas! I visiting thad
ole fadder an&#146; mudder ninety-nine
and one hundled years ole, and those
seventeen liddle brudders an&#146; sisters.
You missing me very much?&#148; she
changed from the subject of her whereabouts.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;No!&#148; he said, shortly, stung by her
falsity.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I don&#146; sing so!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Where were you, Yuki?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Now, whad you wan&#146; know for,
sinze you don&#146; like me whicheven?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg&nbsp;89]</span>
&#147;Did I say so?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You say you don&#146; miss.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I lied,&#148; he said, bitterly. &#147;Where
were you?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Jus&#146; over cross street, see my ole
friend ad tea-garden.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I thought you said you were visiting
your people?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">She was not at all abashed.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Sa-ay, firs&#146; you saying you miss me;
then thad you lie. Sa-ay, you big lie,
I jus&#146; liddle bit lie.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Yuki, listen to me. If you leave
me like this again, you need never
come back. Do you understand?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Never?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I mean that.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Whad you goin&#146; do? Git you nudder
wife?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">He pushed her from him in savage
disgust. She laughed with infinite relish.</p>

<p class="indent">He sat down a little distance from her,
and put his face wearily between his
hands. Yuki regarded him a moment,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[pg&nbsp;90]</span>
and then she silently went to him,
pulled his hands down, and kissed his
lips.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I have missed you terribly,&#148; he said,
hoarsely.</p>

<p class="indent">She was all compunction.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I very sawry. I din know you
caring very much for poor liddle me,
an p&#146;raps I bedder nod come bag ad
you.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Why did you come, then?&#148; he asked,
gently.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I coon&#146; help myself,&#148; she said, forlornly.
&#147;My feet aching run bag ad
you, my eyes ill to see you, my hands
gone mad to touch you.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">She had grown in a moment serious,
but also melancholy.</p>

<p class="indent">After a pause she said, more brightly,
&#147;I bringin&#146; you something&mdash;something
so nize, dear my lord.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;What is it, Yuki, dear?&#148; He was
reluctant to let her go even for a moment.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Flowers,&#148; she said&mdash;&#147;summer
flowers.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[pg&nbsp;91]</span>
He released her, and she brought
them to him, a huge bunch of azaleas.
She buried her delightful little nose
in them. &#147;Ah,&#148; she said, &#147;flowers
mos&#146; sweetes&#146; thing in all the worl&#146;,
an&#146; all them same flowers for you, for
you.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Where did you get them, dear?&#148; he
asked, taking her hands instead of the
flowers, and drawing her, flowers and
all, into his arms. She faltered a little,
and then said, with the old daring
smile flashing back in her face:
&#147;Nize Japanese gents making me present
those flowers.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">He caught her wrists in a grip of iron.
&#147;What do you mean?&#148; he demanded,
fiercely, wild jealousy assailing him.</p>

<p class="indent">She pulled herself from him, and regarded
the little wrists ruefully.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Ain&#146; you shamed?&#148; she accused.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Yes!&#148; He kissed the little wrists
with an inward sob. &#147;Tell me all, my
little one. Please do not hide anything
from me. I can&#146;t bear it.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg&nbsp;92]</span>
&#147;Thad Japanese gent wanter marry
with me,&#148; she informed him, calmly
smiling, and dimpling as if it amused
her, and then making a face to show
him her feelings in the matter.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;My! How he <i>adore</i> me!&#148; she added,
vividly.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Marry with you! What do you
mean? You are my wife.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Yes, bud <i>he</i> din know thad,&#148; she
said, consolingly; &#147;an&#146; see, I bring
his same flowers unto you.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">He took them from her arms. They
were all crushed now, and it distressed
her. No Japanese can bear to see a
flower abused. She fingered some of
the petals sadly; then she sighed, looking
up at him with tears in her
eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Tha&#146;s mos&#146; beautiful thing&#146; in all
the whole worl&#146;,&#148; she said, indicating
the flowers&mdash;&#147;so pure, so kind, so
sweet.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I know something more beautiful
and sweet, and&mdash;and pure.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[pg&nbsp;93]</span>
&#147;Ah, whad?&#148; she said, her face shining,
the pupils of the blue eyes so large
as to make them look almost black.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;My wife!&#148; he breathed.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>VIII<br/>
YUKI&#146;S HOME</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Every</span> day, all unknown to Yuki,
her husband looked in her little jewel-box.
The pile of bills grew larger.
He no longer refused her requests for
money. The fund was quite large now.
The last time he had counted it there
were four hundred dollars. He took a
whim to make it five hundred, and
that same day gave her a clear hundred
dollars.</p>

<p class="indent">She had given him a solemn promise
never to leave him again without his
knowledge and consent, and for a whole
month she had kept steadfastly at home.
It was the happiest month in his life, a
month that spelled naught else but joy
and sunshine.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg&nbsp;95]</span>
But the day after he had given her
the hundred dollars she came to him
and begged very humbly to be permitted
to visit her old father and mother and
seventeen little brothers and sisters.
She still kept up this deception. He
refused her almost gruffly. He had
grown selfish and spoiled under her
care. All the day, however, he watched
her suspiciously, fearful lest she should
slip away. And he was right. In the
evening, when she had left him for a
moment, he saw her leaving the house.
He took his hat, and, keeping at a
good distance from her, but never losing
sight of her for a moment, he followed
her.</p>

<p class="indent">Twilight was falling. Softly, tenderly,
the darkness swept away the exquisite
rays of red and yellow that the
departing sun had left behind, for it
was crossing the waters, until, far in
the distance, it dipped deep down as
though swallowed up by the bay.</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki was walking rapidly towards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[pg&nbsp;96]</span>
Tokyo. It was only a short distance,
but nevertheless the thought of her little
tender feet treading it alone, and at
such an hour, unnerved her husband.
Whatever her mission, wherever she was
going, he would follow her. She belonged
to him completely. She should
never escape him now, he told himself.</p>

<p class="indent">She seemed to know her way, and
showed no hesitation or fear when
once in Tokyo, but bent her steps quickly
and with assurance, until finally
they were before the great terminal
station at Shimbashi. They had now
come a long distance. The girl looked
tired: weary shadows were under her
eyes, as she passed into the railway
enclosure and bought a ticket for a town
suburb a short distance from Tokyo.</p>

<p class="indent">Her husband went to the window, inquired
where the girl was going, and
bought a ticket for the same place.</p>

<p class="indent">Then began the long journey in the
uncomfortable train, where there were
no sleeping accommodations whatever.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg&nbsp;97]</span>
Yuki found a seat, and sat very quietly
staring out at the flying darkness.
After a time she put her head back
against the seat and, despite the jolting
of the train, fell asleep.</p>

<p class="indent">Her husband was close to her now&mdash;in
the next seat, in fact. He could
have touched her, as he so longed to
do, but would not for fear of disturbing
or frightening her.</p>

<p class="indent">When they reached the little town,
the banging of the doors, the blowing
of whistles, and shouts of the conductors
awakened her. She came to life with
a start, gathered her little belongings
together, and left the train, her husband
still following her.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a refined and beautiful little
town they had arrived at, apparently
the home of the exclusive and cultivated
Japanese. Its atmosphere was grateful
and pleasing after the crowded
city of Tokyo, with its endless labyrinth
of narrow streets and grotesque signboards,
and ceaseless noises.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[pg&nbsp;98]</span>
Yuki had not far to walk. Only a
few steps from the little station, and
then she was before one of those old-fashioned,
pretentious palaces once affected
by the nobles. There were signs
of neglect about the house and gardens,
which had fallen out of repair. No coolies
or servants were in sight. At the
garden gate Yuki paused a moment,
leaning wearily against it, ere she
opened and passed through, up the garden
walk, and disappeared into the
shadows of the palace.</p>

<p class="indent">Her husband stood for a long time
as though rooted to the spot. Then
very slowly he retraced his steps to the
railway station, bought his ticket, and
returned to Tokyo. He felt sure she
would come back to him.</p>

<p class="indent">And she did, hardly two days later.
He was very gentle to her this time.
There were no more questions asked,
and she vouchsafed no explanation.</p>

<p class="indent">But she came back to him strangely
docile and submissive. All the old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg&nbsp;99]</span>
mockery and folly had vanished. She
was angelic in her sweet tenderness
and solicitude. But once he found
her in tears. She protested they had
come there because she had laughed
so hard. Another time, when he offered
her money, she refused passionately to
accept it. It was the first time since
she had lived with him. Thereafter
she refused to take even the regular
weekly allowance agreed upon. He
looked in her little jewel-box, and found
the money all gone.</p>

<p class="indent">Her docility and gentleness strengthened
his confidence in her. He was
sure she would never leave him again.
He even told her of this belief, and she
did not deny it. But her eyes were tearful.
With boyish insistence he teased
her.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Tell me so&mdash;that you will never leave
me again.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Never?&#148; she said, but the word slipped
her lips as a question.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Repeat it after me,&#148; he demanded.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg&nbsp;100]</span>
&#147;Say: &#145;I&mdash;shall&mdash;never&mdash;never&mdash;leave
you again.&#146;&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Ah, you makin&#146; fun ad me,&#148; she
protested, begging the question.</p>

<p class="indent">But he still persisted, and made her
repeat slowly after him, word by word,
that she would remain with him till
death should part them.</p>

<p class="indent">One day he found her laboriously
occupied at her small writing-desk.
Her little hand flew down the page,
rapidly drawing the strange characters
of her country&#146;s letters.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;What are you doing? You look
as wise and solemn as a female
Buddha.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki carefully blotted and covered
her letter. She did not answer him.
Instead she held up her little stained
fingers, to show him the ink on them.
He sat down beside her, kissing the
tips of her fingers.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;To whom were you writing, fairy-sage?&#148;
he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;To whom? My brudder.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg&nbsp;101]</span>
&#147;Your brother! Ah, you have a
brother, have you? And where is
he?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">She still hesitated, and he watched
her keenly.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;He live ad Japan,&#148; she said, after
a long moment.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Japan is quite a big place,&#148; remarked
her husband, suggestively.
&#147;He has rather large quarters for one
fellow, don&#146;t you think?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Japan liddle bit country,&#148; she
argued, trying to change the subject.
&#147;America, perhaps, grade big place,
big as half the whole worl&#146;&mdash;&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Not quite,&#148; interposed her husband,
smiling.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Well, big&#146;s one-quarter of the worl&#146;,
anyhow,&#148; she declared. &#147;Bud Japan!
Mos&#146; liddle bit insignificant spot on all
the beautiful maps.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;What part of Japan does your
family live in?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Liddle bit town two hundled miles
north of Tokyo.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg&nbsp;102]</span>
&#147;Indeed.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">She had spoken the truth, he knew.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Why doesn&#146;t your brother come to
see you?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Now that he had commenced it, he
stuck to his catechism doggedly.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;He don&#146;t know where I live,&#148; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Don&#146;t know! That&#146;s strange. Why
doesn&#146;t he?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I &#145;fraid tellin&#146;.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Afraid of what?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Afraid he disowning me forever.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Why should he do that?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">He was getting interested. He disliked
wringing her secrets from her in
this wise. He wanted her confidence
unsolicited; but his curiosity had the
better of him. &#147;Why should he disown
you?&#148; he repeated.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Because I marrying&mdash;&#148; she paused,
somewhat piteously, holding one of
his hands closely between her own
small ones, and entreatingly pressing
it as though begging him not to pursue
his questions.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg&nbsp;103]</span>
&#147;Well?&#148; he said&mdash;&#147;because you
married&mdash;&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You,&#148; she finished.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Oh!&#148; His ejaculation was rueful.
Then he laughed, and squared his
shoulders, and shook his finger at
her.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;What&#146;s the matter with me? Am
I not good enough?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Too honorably good,&#148; she declared,
humbly.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Then why does your family object
to receiving me into its bosom, eh?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Because you jus&#146; barbarian,&#148; she
said, apologetically, and then swiftly
tried to make amends. &#147;Barbarian
mos&#146; nize of all. Also <i>I</i> am liddle bit
barbarian. I god them same barbarous
eyes an&#146; oogly hair&mdash;&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Loveliest hair in the world,&#148; he
said, stroking it fondly. &#147;But never
mind, dearie. Don&#146;t look so distressed.
It&#146;s not your fault, of course, that your
people disapprove of me.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;They don&#146; dis&#146;prove,&#148; she interrupted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg&nbsp;104]</span>
him, her distress deepening.
&#147;They don&#146; never seen you even.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;But I thought you said&mdash;&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I jus&#146; guess. Tha&#146;s why I don&#146;
tell thad brudder. Mebbe he dis&#146;prove
you when he see you grade big barbarian.
Tha&#146;s bedder nod tell unto him.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;But where does he think you are
all the time?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;He?&#148; She lost her head a moment.
&#147;Likewise,&#148; she continued, &#147;he
also travel from home. Perhaps he
also marrying with beautiful barbarian
leddy. Tha&#146;s whad I dunno.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I don&#146;t quite understand,&#148; said her
husband. &#147;But never mind. If you
don&#146;t like the subject, and it&#146;s plain you
don&#146;t, you sha&#146;n&#146;t be bothered with it.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Thangs,&#148; she said, gratefully.</p>

<p class="indent">On another day, as she sat opening
his American mail with her small
paper-knife, a picture of a young American
girl fell from the envelope. Yuki
picked it up, and regarded it with dilated
eyes and lips that quivered. It was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg&nbsp;105]</span>
first shock of jealousy she had experienced.
One of his own country-women
then must love him. No Japanese
girl would send her picture to
any man save her lover.</p>

<p class="indent">Her first impulse was to tear the picture
across. She did not want him
to see it. Perhaps even the pictured
face might win him back, she thought
jealously. But she did not destroy it.
She hid it in the sleeve of her kimono,
and for a whole week she tortured
herself with drawing it forth from its
hiding-place and studying the face
whenever she was alone a moment,
comparing it with her own exquisite
one in her small mirror.</p>

<p class="indent">Then conscience, or perhaps natural
feminine curiosity to know who her
rival was, prompted her to make humble
confession to her husband of her theft.</p>

<p class="indent">He took the matter gayly, and seemed
exuberantly happy at the idea of her
being jealous, for she could not well
hide this fact from him. He gloated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg&nbsp;106]</span>
over this apparent evidence of her love
for him.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Isn&#146;t she lovely?&#148; he asked, enthusiastically,
pointing to the picture,
and then pretending to hug it to him.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;No,&#148; said Yuki, proudly. &#147;Mos&#146;
oogly girl in all the whole worl&#146;. Soach
silliest things on her haed. I don&#146;
keer tha&#146;s hat or nod. Flowers, birds,
beas&#146;, perhaps, an&#146; rollin&#146; her eyes this-a-way&mdash;&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;This is my sister,&#148; said Jack,
gravely. &#147;I am sorry you don&#146;t like
her, Yuki. She&#146;d be just the sort of
girl to love you.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Her little spurt of temper flickered
out pitifully.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Ah, <i>pray</i> forgive me,&#148; she implored.
&#147;I mos&#146; silliest <i>mousm&#232;</i> in all
Japan. She jus&#146; <i>lovely</i>, mos&#146; sweet
beautiful girl in all the whole worl&#146;.
Jus&#146; like you, my lord.&#148;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>IX<br/>
THE MIKADO&#146;S BIRTHDAY</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> mellow summer was gone.
With the dawn of the autumn the
languor of the country seemed to increase.
Now that the weather was
cooler, however, they made frequent
trips to the city, visiting the chrysanthemum
shows, loitering through
Uyeno park, the Shiba temples, and
bazaars. And one day Jack shook
gayly before her eyes a really awe-inspiring
document. It was, in fact,
an invitation, written in fine French,
from a Japanese person of high rank,
inviting him to attend a very important
function, which was to be given
at the H&#244;tel Imperial on the Mikado&#146;s
birthday, which function was to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg&nbsp;108]</span>
honored by the presence of &#147;les princes
et les princesses.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;We are going, of course,&#148; he told
her. &#147;It will be a change, and, besides,
I want to show you off to my friends.
There&#146;ll be hosts of them there, you
know.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">But she protested. First she set
forth as excuse the fact that she was
only an honorably rude and insignificant
humble geisha girl, who would
be out of place in so great and extraordinary
an assemblage.</p>

<p class="indent">Then her husband quite seriously
reproved her, and reminded her forcibly
that she was anything but an insignificant
geisha girl. She was, in fact, a
very important person&mdash;his wife.</p>

<p class="indent">Ah, yes, she admitted that she had
indeed grown in caste since her marriage
with him; nevertheless, they
had lived so honorably secluded together
that she had forgotten all the
polite mannerisms of society, which she
had never been acquainted with at all,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[pg&nbsp;109]</span>
being only a crude girl of humble parentage.
She would surely disgrace not
only both of them by her behavior, but
doubtless the whole assemblage. She
would not know how to act, how to look,
and when to speak.</p>

<p class="indent">Then Jack insisted, with affected
selfishness, that she should look at
and speak to no one but himself. He
would commit hari-kari, or joshi, or
any old kind of Japanese suicide, otherwise.
And as for her manners, they
were lovely, perfect, just right.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Ah, bud you&mdash;&#148; she deprecated.
&#147;You don&#146; understan&#146;, you big barbarian.
Those same honorable monsters,
Japanese princes, whad, before
all the gods, they goin&#146; to thing of
me?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;That you are absolutely adorable.
How could they help thinking so, unless
they are stone blind. Besides,
this isn&#146;t a Japanese affair at all. It&#146;s
at a European hotel, and there&#146;ll be
all sorts and conditions of people there.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[pg&nbsp;110]</span>
I was lucky to get the invitations.
They aren&#146;t for every one, you know.
This is a big thing.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;<i>You</i> so big,&#148; she said, proudly.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Well, no. It had really nothing
to do with my size. You see, I have
a half-Jap friend in America, and of
course it&#146;s through him I&#146;m favored.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Ah, thad half-Jap, he was very
high-up man ad Japan, perhaps?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Well, he was connected with some
of the big families, though he was quite
poor.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Thad,&#148; said Yuki, with sudden
vehemence, &#147;is no madder ad Japan.
Money! Who has thad money? Nod
the ole families, the flower of the country;
jus&#146; the shop-keepers and the
politicians.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Her husband was startled at her
outbreak. He was astonished at her
knowledge of existing conditions in
her country. But she did not pursue
the subject, saying she disliked it.</p>

<p class="indent">And the ball? What about that?</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg&nbsp;111]</span>
Well, she would not go with him.
He must go to that all alone, for the
million big reasons she had given him.
Moreover, all the ladies would wear
Parisian toilettes. It would be a disgrace
for his wife to go in a kimono.</p>

<p class="indent">Again he was astonished at her.
How did she know that on such occasions
the ladies, Japanese included,
dressed in European gowns?</p>

<p class="indent">Apparently she knew more concerning
such matters than he had imagined.
It was becoming plainer to him every
day that his wife was of no ordinary
family. And then the memory of the
old rambling palace, doubtless her home,
in the exquisite, aristocratic little town
where he had followed her, supported
this idea. Who was his wife, after all?
Who were her people, and why had
none of them come near her during all
these months? What was the meaning
of the mystery in which she had
surrounded herself ever since he had
known her. And now, when there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[pg&nbsp;112]</span>
was scarcely a doubt left in his mind
of her love for him, why had he failed
to win her confidence?</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I want to know just who you are,
my little wife,&#148; he suddenly said. &#147;I
do not believe that tale about your
people. I know you are not a geisha
girl. You are not, are you?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;No,&#148; she said, very softly.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Then tell me. Who are your people?
It is only right I should know
this.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">She looked up at him with intense
seriousness. Then her eyes fluttered,
and she went rambling into one of her
fairy tales of nonsense.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;My people? Who they are? My
august ancestors came from the moon.
My one hundled grade-grandfathers
fight and fight and fight like the lion,
and conquer one-half of all Japan&mdash;fight
the shogun, fight the kazoku, fight each
other. They were great Samourai,
cutting off the haeds of aevery humble
mans they don&#146; like. So much bloodshed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[pg&nbsp;113]</span>
displeased the gods. They punishing
all my ancestors, bringin&#146; them
down to thad same poverty of those
honorable peebles killed by them.
Then much distress an&#146; sadness come
forever ad our house. All pride, all
haughty boasting daed forever. Aeverybody
goin&#146; &#145;bout weepin&#146; like ad a funeral.
Nobody habby. What they goin&#146;
do git bag thad power an&#146; reeches ag&#146;in?
Also one ancestor have grade big family
to keep from starving, an&#146; one daughter
beautiful as the moon of her ancestors.
He weep more than all the rest of those
ancestors, weep an&#146; weep till he go blind
like an owl ad day-time. Then the
gods begin feel sawry. One of them
mos&#146; sawry of all. He also is descendant
of the Sun. Well, thad sun-god
he comin&#146; down ad Japan, make big
raddle an&#146; noise, an&#146; marrying with thad
same beautifullest daughter of thad ole
blind ancestor. Thad sun-god my fadder.
Me? I am the half-moon-half-sun
offspring.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg&nbsp;114]</span>
She had promised to accompany him,
at all events, to see the review from
the American-legation tent, but at
the last moment she backed out. She
had seen it many times before, she
declared. She was tired of it.</p>

<p class="indent">At first he swore he would not go
without her. Why, the &#147;show,&#148; he
declared, would be nothing to him without
her to see it with him. Half the
pleasure&mdash;nay, all of it&mdash;would be gone.
He was really keenly disappointed, but
she coaxed and wheedled and petted
around him, till, before he knew that he
was aggrieved at her backsliding, he
was well on his way.</p>

<p class="indent">The streets were thronged with a
motley crowd of people. Jinrikishas
were scurrying hither and thither,
and little bits of humanity, in the shape
of small men, small women, small children,
and small dogs and cats, were
colliding and jostling against the many
ramshackle vehicles in the road. Gay
flags and bunting were displayed everywhere,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg&nbsp;115]</span>
and the town presented a gala
appearance.</p>

<p class="indent">Jack got out of his jinrikisha and
pushed his way through the crowd
until he came up to the parade-grounds.
He found his way to the proper tent,
and, with a half-score of former acquaintances
about him, he was soon
drawn into the babble and gush of
small talk and jokes that tourists meeting
each other in foreign lands usually
indulge in.</p>

<p class="indent">Once on the parade-grounds, where
infantry, cavalry, and artillery were
forming themselves, it seemed as if he
had suddenly left Japan altogether, and
was once more in the modern Western
world, of which he had always been a
part.</p>

<p class="indent">There was nothing Oriental in this
brave display of the imperial army.
There was nothing Oriental in this
bustling, noisy crowd of foreigners,
each trying to outdo the other in importance
and precedence. Only the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[pg&nbsp;116]</span>
skies and the little winds, and, in the
distance, the sinuous outlines of the
mountains and forests beyond, and the
disks on the national flag displayed
everywhere, were Japanese. And after
his long seclusion in the country the
glitter dazzled him.</p>

<p class="indent">There were seven thousand men in
the field, and the Mikado, surrounded
by his generals, body-guard, outriders,
and standard-bearers, reviewed the
troops; and then, amid a great flourish,
and hoarse cheering drowning the
national hymn, which was being played
by all the bands at once, he left the
grounds.</p>

<p class="indent">Jack did not return after the parade
to his home, much as he would have
liked to do so. Some acquaintances
who had crossed on the same steamer
with him on his way to Japan carried
him off triumphantly to their hotel, and
that night he went with them to the
imperial ball.</p>

<p class="indent">It was very late when he went home
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[pg&nbsp;117]</span>
to Yuki. There was a faint light burning
in the zashishi, and he wondered
with some concern whether she were
sitting up waiting for him. He did
not see her at first when he entered
the room, for the light of the andon had
fluttered down dimly, and it was more
the grayness of the approaching dawn
which saved the room from complete
darkness. Crossing the room, he came
upon her. She had fallen asleep on
the floor. She was lying on her back,
her arms encircling her head. He was
suddenly struck with her extreme youth.
She seemed little more than a tired
child, who had grown weary and had
fallen asleep among her toys, for beside
her on a tiny foot-high table was the
little supper she had prepared for him,
and which was now quite cold. On the
other side of her were her tiny drum and
samisen, with which she had been attempting
doubtless to pass the evening
by pulling from the strings some
of that weird music he knew so well now.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[pg&nbsp;118]</span>
For a long time her husband looked
at her, and a feeling of intense isolation
about her came over and suddenly possessed
him. Why had he never been
able to bridge that strange distance
which lay like a pall between them,
the feeling always that she was not
wholly his own, that she had been but
a guest within his house, a tiny wild
bird that he had caught in some strange
way and caged&mdash;caught, though she
had come to him, as it were, for protection?
Just as, when a boy, he remembered
how a robin had beaten at his
shutters, and he had saved it from an
enemy, and afterwards how he had caged
it, and how it had pined for its freedom.</p>

<p class="indent">The thought that he might yet lose
Yuki caused him such anguish of mind
it almost stunned him. He knelt down
beside her, and drew her up in his arms,
and then, as gently as a mother would
have done, he carried her up the queer
spiral stairway which led to their little
up-stairs room.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>[pg&nbsp;119]</span>
The next day she questioned him
anxiously. Were there many ladies
more beautiful than she at the ball?
Had he enjoyed himself largely with
them, and how could he live away hereafter
from such mirth and gayety?
Why had he come back to little, insignificant
her?</p>

<p class="indent">And he told her that never in all his
life before had he longed so ardently
for any one as he had for her that previous
night. That the day had been
endless; the noise and show, the brassy
merriment and cheer, were abhorrent
to him, for she had not been there to
rob it of its vulgarity with the charm
of her sweet presence. That he had
been rude in his efforts to escape it, had
bullied the jinrikimen because they
had seemed to creep, and that happiness
and peace had only come back to him
again when he had crossed his own
threshold and had taken her in his arms.</p>

<p class="indent">Still the wistful distress in her misty
eyes was only in part dispelled.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[pg&nbsp;120]</span>
&#147;Last night,&#148; she said, &#147;I broke
my liddle jade bracelet. It is a bad
omen.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I will buy you a dozen new ones,&#148;
he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;One million dozens cannot mend
jus&#146; thad liddle one,&#148; she returned,
sadly, shaking her head. &#147;It is a bad
omen. Mebbe a warning from the
gods.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Of what did they warn her? That
she could not say, but she had heard
that such an accident usually preceded
the sorrows of love. Perhaps he would
soon pass away from her, and, like the
ghost of the fisher-boy Urashima, who
had left his fairy bride to return to his
people, he too would pass out of her
life, back into that from which he had
come.</p>

A BAD OMEN</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was late in November. The parks
were dropping their autumn glories and
taking on the browner hues and hints
of hoar-frost, black-and-white vestments,
the sackcloth and ashes of
winter. The recessional of the birds
was dying away into silence. Soon
the final, long-drawn amen of the
north-wind would be breathed out over
the deserted woods, where the anthem
of praise had rung out to the worshipping
air all through the golden days
and silver nights of summer.</p>

<p class="indent">The still beauty of the autumn evening
was piercingly melancholy, and,
even with a loving sunset still lingering
in the skies, a silken, gentle rain was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>[pg&nbsp;122]</span>
falling, as though the gods were weeping
over the death of the autumn, were
weeping hopeless tears&mdash;the most tragic
of all.</p>

<p class="indent">The little house that stood alone on
the hill faced to the west, its wet roofs
and shingles sparkling and glistening
in the rays of the dying sunset that
enveloped it.</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki opened a shoji (sliding paper
door) of her chamber, and looked out
wistfully at the city of Tokyo, that
in the autumn silence was shining out
like a gem, with its many strange
lights and colors. She stole softly out
on to a small balcony, and stepped down
into the tiny garden as the night began
to spread its mantle of darkness. A few
minutes later her husband called to her:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Yuki! Yuki!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">He drew her into the room, and closed
the shoji behind her.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You have been crying again!&#148; he
said, sharply, and turned her face up
to the light.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>[pg&nbsp;123]</span>
&#147;It is the rain on my face, my lord,&#148;
she answered in the smallest voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;But you mustn&#146;t go out in the rain.
You are quite wet, dear.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Soach a little, gentle rain,&#148; she
said. &#147;It will not hurt jus&#146; me. I loogin&#146;
aeverywhere &#145;bout for our liddle
bit poor nightingale. Gone! Perhaps
daed! Aeverything dies&mdash;bird, flowers,
mebbe&mdash;me!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">He put his hand over her mouth with
a hurt exclamation.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Don&#146;t!&#148; he only said.</p>

<p class="indent">The maid brought in their supper on
a tray, but before she could set it down
Yuki had impetuously crossed the room
and taken it from her hands.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Go, go, honorable maid,&#148; she said.
&#147;I will with my own hands attend my
lord&#146;s honorable appetite.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">She knelt at his feet, geisha fashion,
holding the tray and waiting for him
to eat, but he took it from her gravely,
and put it on the small table beside them,
and then silently, tenderly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>[pg&nbsp;124]</span>
he took her small hands in his
own.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;What is troubling you, Yuki? You
must tell me. You are hiding something
from me. What has become
of my little mocking-bird? I cannot
live without it.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You also los&#146; liddle bird?&#148; she
queried, softly&mdash;&#147;jus&#146; lige unto my same
liddle nightingale?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I have lost&mdash;I am losing you,&#148; he
said, suddenly, with a burst of anguish.
&#147;I cannot make you out these last few
weeks. What has come over you? I
miss your laughing and your singing.
You are always sad now; your eyes&mdash;ah,
I cannot bear it.&#148; His voice went
suddenly anxious. &#147;Tell me, is it&mdash;do
you&mdash;want&mdash;need some more money,
Yuki? You know you can have all you
want.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">She sprang to her feet fiercely.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;No, no, no, no!&#148; she cried; &#147;naever
any more for all my life long, <i>dear</i> my
lord.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[pg&nbsp;125]</span>
&#147;Then why&mdash;&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Ah, <i>pray</i> don&#146; ask why.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;But why&mdash;&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Then listen unto me. I nod any
longer thad liddle bit geisha girl you
marrying with. I change grade big
moach. Now you see me, I am one
wooman, mebbe like wooman one
hundled years ole&mdash;wise&mdash;sad&mdash;I
change!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Yes,&#148; he said. &#147;You are changed.
You are my Undine, and I have found
your soul at last!&#148;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">One oppressive afternoon, when a nagging,
bleating wind out-doors had prevented
their going on their customary
ramble through the woods or on a
little trip to the city, Jack had fallen
asleep. Long before he had awakened
he had felt her warm, soothing presence
near him, but with the pleasure it afforded
him was mingled a premonition of
disaster and a dread of something unhappy
about her? He awoke to find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>[pg&nbsp;126]</span>
her standing by him, her face white and
drawn with a despair he could not comprehend.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;What is it?&#148; He started up fearfully.
&#147;Your eyes are tragic! You
look as if you were contemplating
something frightful.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">She sank down to his feet, and, despite
his protests, knelt and clung to him
there, sobbing with passionate abandon.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Don&#146;t! Don&#146;t! I can&#146;t bear you to
do that. What is it, Yuki?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Oh, for liddle while, jus&#146; liddle bit
while, bear with me,&#148; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Little while! What do you mean?&#148;
he demanded.</p>

<p class="indent">She tried to regain her composure.
Her laughter was piteous.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I only liddle bit skeered,&#148; she said.
&#147;I&mdash;&#148; she stammered&mdash;&#147;I skeered &#145;bout
thad liddle foolish jade bracelet, all
smashed and broken.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Is that all?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;It is soach a bad omen! The gods
trying to separate us, mebbe.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>[pg&nbsp;127]</span>
&#147;Separate us?&#148; His suspicions were
growing. &#147;How can they do that?
It lies between you and me, such a&mdash;such
a fate. The gods&mdash;ah, you are
talking nonsense.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;The gods see inside,&#148; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Inside what?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Our hearts.&#148; Her voice was barely
above a whisper.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;And what can they find there to
distress you?&#148; he asked, almost fiercely.
She was hurting him with her failure to
confide in him.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;The bracelet&mdash;&#148; she began. &#147;It is
broken, an&#146; love, too, mus&#146; die&mdash;an&#146;
break!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">From that day her melancholy grew
rather than diminished. But she had
roused her husband&#146;s suspicions, and
her morbidness irritated rather than appealed
to him. He felt that in some
way he was being deceived. The day
that he found her wardrobe neatly and
carefully folded away in her queer little
packing-case, as though in preparation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>[pg&nbsp;128]</span>
for a journey, the full sense of her deceit
dawned upon him. Hitherto when she
had left him she had taken none of her
belongings with her. He perceived it
was now her intention to desert him
utterly. He had served her purpose,
apparently, and she was through with
him.</p>

<p class="indent">His wrath burst its bounds. He
had not known the capabilities of his
angry passion. He tore the silken
garments from the box with the fierce
madness of one demented, then he
pushed her into the room, and showed
her where they lay scattered.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;The meaning of this?&#148; he demanded,
white to the lips with the intensity
of his passion.</p>

<p class="indent">She remained mute. She did not
even trouble to mock or laugh at him,
nor would she weep. She seemed
dazed and bewildered, and he, infuriated
against her, said things which
rankled in his conscience for years
afterwards.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>[pg&nbsp;129]</span>
&#147;Does a promise mean nothing to
you&mdash;a promise&mdash;an oath itself? Were
you, parrot-like, merely echoing my
words when you swore to stay by me
until&mdash;&#148; his voice broke&mdash;&#147;death?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Still she made him no denial, and
her silence maddened him, and drove
him on with his bitter arraignment.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;What your object has been I fail to
see, but you cannot deny that you have
laid yourself out, have used every effort,
every art and wile, of which you are
mistress, to make me believe in you.
And I&mdash;I&mdash;like a blind, deluded fool&mdash;ah,
Yuki&mdash;there is something wrong,
some hideous mistake somewhere. You
have some secret, some trouble. Be
frank with me. Can&#146;t you see&mdash;understand
how I&mdash;I am suffering?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">She roused herself with an effort, but
her words were pitifully conventional.
She apologized for the trouble and
noise she had brought into his house.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You have not answered me!&#148; he
cried. &#147;What was your intention? Did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>[pg&nbsp;130]</span>
you intend to leave me? You shall answer
me that!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;It was bedder so,&#148; she said, and
her voice fainted. She could speak
no further.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Then such was your intention!&#148;
He could hardly believe her words.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>XI<br/>
THE NIGHTINGALE</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">When</span> Love lives after Trust is dead,
then peace is an unknown quantity.
A constraint that was baffling in its
intense hopelessness now hedged up
between these two. Yuki grew thin
and wistful. Her whole attitude became
one of pitiful attempted conciliation
and humility, which with bitter
suspicion her husband took to be confusion
and guilt. Had she even affected
somewhat of her old light-heartedness
and attempted to win his forgiveness
by her old audacious wiles,
her husband would have forgotten and
forgiven everything, glad of an excuse
to renew the old close comradeship with
her. But she made no such attempt.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>[pg&nbsp;132]</span>
She had acquired a peculiar fear of
her husband, and unconsciously shrank
from him, as though dreading to bring
down on herself his further displeasure.
She kept away from him as much as
she could, though at times she made
spasmodic, frantic efforts to assume her
old light-heartedness, but these efforts
were usually followed by passionate
outbursts of tears, when she had drawn
the shoji between them, and was once
more alone with her own inward
thoughts, whatever they were.</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile her husband kept the
watch of a jailer over her. He was
convinced that she was waiting for a
chance to leave him, and this he was determined
to frustrate. She had raised
in him a feeling of the intensest bitterness,
which amounted almost to antagonism
towards her. And still beneath
all this resentment and bitterness a
tenderness and yearning for her threatened
to strangle and overpower all other
feeling. Her apparent fear of him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>[pg&nbsp;133]</span>
hurt him terribly, and caused him distractedly
at times to question whether
he had been as kind to her as he might
have been. Then his mind would inevitably
revert to the fact that she was
planning to leave him, and his resentment
would burn fiercer than ever.</p>

<p class="indent">By a common dread of the subject,
both of them avoided alluding to it, and
for this reason it weighed the heavier
on their minds. He feared that any
explanation she might attempt to make
to him would only be some excuse put
forward to reconcile him, and win his
consent to the impossible situation
which he instinctively knew she intended
to consummate. She, on the other
hand, watched wildly to turn the subject,
dreading his wrath, which she was
conscious was righteous.</p>

<p class="indent">To add to the gloom of their strained
relations, a season of drizzly wet weather
set in, which confined them to the house,
and moreover Yuki was grieving and
pining over the loss of a favorite nightingale
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>[pg&nbsp;134]</span>
that had made its home in the
tall bamboo out in the midnight garden
of their little home. Jack was misanthropic
and cynical, restless as it is
possible for a man to be under such
galling circumstances, yearning nevertheless
for things to be as they had
been between him and his wife.</p>

<p class="indent">One night, at dusk, after an exceptionally
sad and chilly meal in-doors,
Jack had come out alone, and was
trying to soothe his senses with a fragrant
cigar. Instinctively he was
waiting for his wife. He missed her
if she was absent from his side but a
moment. Suddenly out of the gloaming
soared out one long, thrilling note
of sheer ecstasy and bliss, that quivered
and quavered a moment, and then
floated away into the maddest peals of
melody, ending in a sob that was excruciating
in its intense humanness.
The nightingale had returned!</p>

<p class="indent">He sprang to his feet, and, trembling
by the veranda rail, stared outward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>[pg&nbsp;135]</span>
into the darkness. And then? Yuki
came out from the shadows of their
garden, and under the light of the
moon, beneath their small balcony,
she looked up into his eyes, and murmured
in a voice thrilled by an inward
sob, so timid and meek, so beseeching
and prayerful:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I lige please you, my lord!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;The nightingale!&#148; he whispered,
with hoarse emotion. &#147;Did you hear
it? It has returned!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Nay, my lord&mdash;tha&#146;s jus&#146; me! I
jus&#146; a liddle echo!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">She had learned the voice of the
nightingale.</p>

<hr/>

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">THE NIGHTINGALE SONG</p>
</div>
</div>

<hr/>

<p class="indent">With an exclamation of indescribable
tenderness he drew her into his arms,
and for a few moments at least all the
misery and pain and constraint of the
last few weeks between them passed
away and gave place to all their pent-up
love and loneliness.</p>

<p class="indent">As he held her close to him, he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>[pg&nbsp;136]</span>
conscious at first only of the fact that
she loved him, that she was clinging to
him with somewhat of her old abandon,
and then he felt her hands upon his
arms. He could almost see them
shaking and trembling. She was attempting
to release herself! Struggling
to be free! All of a sudden he
released her, and stood breathing hard,
his arms folded across his breast, waiting
for her to do or say something to him.</p>

<p class="indent">She did not move. She stood before
him, with her head down; and then
her blue eyes lifted, and timidly, appealingly,
they beseeched his own. She
started to speak, stammered only a
few incoherent words, and then, with
a half-sob, she unsteadily crossed the
room and left him alone.</p>

<p class="indent">Two days later, upon their household
gloom came word from Taro Burton,
announcing that he had arrived in
Tokyo. Jack rushed off to meet him,
telling Yuki he expected an old friend,
and would bring him home that evening.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>XII<br/>
TARO BURTON</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">It</span> may be that Jack Bigelow first
awoke to the fact that for months he
had been literally living in a dream-world
when he saw his old college-chum,
Taro Burton&mdash;the same dear,
old, grave Taro! He rushed up to
him in the old boyish fashion, wringing
his hands with unaffected delight.</p>

<p class="indent">The past dream-months rolled for the
moment from his memory, and Jack
was once again the happy up-to-date
American boy.</p>

<p class="indent">Taro had been delayed in America,
he now told the other frankly, on account
of the failure of his people to
send him passage money until about a
month ago. He had a few hardships to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>[pg&nbsp;138]</span>
recount and some messages to deliver
from mutual friends, and then he wanted
to know all about Jack. Why had
he failed to visit his people as promised?
How much of the country had he seen?
Why were his letters so few and far
between?</p>

<p class="indent">Jack Bigelow laughed shortly.
&#147;Burton, old man,&#148; he said, &#147;I&#146;ve been
dead to everything in Japan&mdash;in the
world, in fact&mdash;save one entrancing
subject.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Yes?&#148; The other was curious. &#147;And
that is&mdash;?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;My wife.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Your wife!&#148; Taro stopped short.
They were crossing the main street of
Tokyo on foot.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Yes,&#148; said the other, laughing
boyishly, all his resentment against
the girl lost and forgiven for the time
being.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;And so you did it, after all?&#148; said
the other, with slow, bitter emphasis.
His friend, then, was little different
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>[pg&nbsp;139]</span>
from other foreigners who marry only
to desert.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Did what?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Got a wife.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Got a wife! Why, man, she came
to me. She&#146;s a witch, the sun-goddess
herself. She&#146;s had me under her spell
all these months. She has hypnotized
me.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;And still has you under her spell?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I am wider awake to-day,&#148; said
Jack, soberly.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;And soon,&#148; said Taro, &#147;you will
be still wider awake, and then&mdash;then
it will be time for her to awaken.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;No!&#148; said Jack, sharply, with bitter
memory. &#147;She has no heart whatever.
She likes to pretend&mdash;that is
all.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;How do you mean?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Simply that we&#146;ve both been pretending
and acting&mdash;I to myself, she
to me; she trying to make me believe
it was all real to her, at any rate these
last two months; I trying to delude myself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>[pg&nbsp;140]</span>
into believing in her, which was
more than my conceit was good for,
after all. Just when I was sure of her,
I accidentally discovered that she was
preparing to desert me altogether.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;She apparently has more sense than
some of them,&#148; said Taro. &#147;Her head
rules her heart.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Oh, entirely,&#148; Jack agreed, quickly,
thinking of the money she had coaxed
from him in the past.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;And you,&#148; Taro turned on him,
&#147;have you come out all right?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Perfectly!&#148; the other laughed with
forced assurance and airiness that deceived
Taro, who was somewhat credulous
by nature. &#147;It wasn&#146;t for a
lifetime, you know,&#148; he added.</p>

<p class="indent">His reply was distasteful to the high
moral sense of Taro Burton&mdash;more, it
pained him, for it brought to him a sudden
and deep disappointment in his
friend. He changed the subject, and
tried to talk about his own people. He
was in a great hurry to go home, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>[pg&nbsp;141]</span>
would linger but a day in Tokyo. He
had arrived sooner than they expected
him. He was hungry for a sight of his
little sister and mother&mdash;they were all
he had in the world.</p>

<p class="indent">Jack&#146;s spirits were dampened for the
moment, as he had expected his friend
to remain with him for a few days.
However, he got Taro&#146;s consent to accompany
him to his home for dinner
that evening, in order to meet the
&#147;Sun-goddess.&#148;</p>
<hr />

<p class="indent">Taro was ushered with great ceremony
into the quaint zashishi, which
was supposed to be entirely Japanese,
and was in reality wholly American,
despite the screens and mats and vases.
Jack ran up-stairs to prepare his wife
to meet his friend.</p>

<p class="indent">The girl was panically dressing in
her best clothes. The maid had brushed
her hair till it glistened. Long
ago her husband had peremptorily forbidden
her the use of oil for the purpose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>[pg&nbsp;142]</span>
of darkening or smoothing it, so it now
shone a rich bronze black and curled
entrancingly around her little ears and
neck. She needed no color for her lips
or cheeks; this also her husband had
forbidden her to use. She looked like
the picture of the sun-goddess in some
old fairy print, her eyes dancing and
shining with excitement, her cheeks
very red and rosy. She was irresistible,
thought her husband, as he held
her at arm&#146;s length. Then, to her great
mortification and chagrin, he lifted her
bodily in his arms and carried her downstairs.
And thus they entered the room,
the girl blushing and struggling in his
arms.</p>

<p class="indent">Taro Burton was standing tall and
erect, his back to the light. He was
very grave, in spite of his friend&#146;s mirth,
and, as Jack set the girl on the floor,
he took a step forward to meet her,
bowing ceremoniously in Japanese fashion.</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki stood up, straightened her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>[pg&nbsp;143]</span>
crumpled gown, and hung her head a
moment.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Yuki, this is my friend, Mr. Burton.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">She raised her head with a quick,
terrified start, and then instantaneously
hers and Taro&#146;s eyes met, and each
recoiled and shrank backward, their
eyes matching each other in the intense
startled look of horror.</p>

<p class="indent">The man&#146;s face had taken on the
color of death, and he was standing,
immovable and silent, almost as if
he were an image of stone. The girl
sank to the floor in a confused heap,
shivering and sobbing.</p>

<p class="indent">Jack turned from her to Taro, and
then back again to the crouching girl.
She was creeping on her knees towards
Taro, but the man, having found the
power of movement, went backward
away from her, aged all in a moment.</p>

<p class="indent">He tried to turn his sick eyes from
her, but they clung, fascinated as is
the needle by the pole.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>[pg&nbsp;144]</span>
And then Jack&#146;s voice, hoarse with a
fear he could not understand, broke in:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Burton, what is the matter?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly the girl sprang to her feet
and rushed to Taro, sobbing and entreating
in Japanese, but the terrible
figure of the man remained immovable.
Jack pulled her forcibly from him.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Burton, dear old friend, what is it?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">The other pushed his hands from him
with almost a blow.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;She is my sister! Oh, my God!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Jack Bigelow felt for an instant as if
the life within him had been stopped.
Then he grasped at a chair and sank
down dazed.</p>

<p class="indent">As though to break up the terrible
silence, the girl commenced to laugh,
but her laughter was terrible, almost
unearthly. The man in the chair
covered his face with his hands; the
other made a movement towards her as
if he would strike her. But she did not
retreat: nay, she leaned towards him.
And her laughter, loud and discordant,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>[pg&nbsp;145]</span>
sank low, and then faded in a tremulous
sob.</p>

<p class="indent">She put out her little speaking, beseeching
hands, and &#147;Sayonara!&#148; she
whispered softly. Then there was stillness
in the room, though the echoes
seemed to repeat &#147;Sayonara,&#148; &#147;Sayonara,&#148;
and again &#147;Sayonara,&#148; and
that means not merely &#147;Farewell,&#148;
but the heart&#146;s resignation: &#147;If it must
be.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Jack and Taro were alone together,
neither breaking by a word the tragic
sadness of that terrible silence. It was
the coming into the room of the maid
that recalled them to life. Twilight
was settling. She brought the lighted
andon and set it in the darkening room.</p>

<p class="indent">Jack got up slowly. The stupor and
horror of it all were not gone from
him, but he crossed to the other man,
and looked into his dull, ashen face.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;My God! Burton, forgive me,&#148; he
said, brokenly; &#147;I am a gentleman.
I will fix it all right. She is my wife,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>[pg&nbsp;146]</span>
and all the world to me. We can remarry
if you wish, and I swear to protect
her with all the love and homage
I would give to any woman who became
my wife.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Yes, you must do that,&#148; said the
other, with weak half-comprehension.
&#147;But where is she?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Where is she?&#148; Jack repeated,
dazedly. They had forgotten her departure.
A dread of her possible loss
possessed and stupefied Jack, and Taro
was half delirious.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;We must look for her at once,&#148; said
Jack.</p>

<p class="indent">They called to her, and all over the
house and through the grounds they
searched for her, their lanterns scanning
the dark shadows under the trees
in the little garden; but only the autumn
winds, sighing in the pine-trees, echoed
her singing minor notes, and mocked
and numbed their senses.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;She must have gone home,&#148; said
the husband.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>[pg&nbsp;147]</span>
&#147;We must go there at once,&#148; said
the brother.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;It will be all right, Burton, dear
old friend. Trust me; you know me
well enough for that.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Taro paused, and turned on him
burning eyes, in which friendliness
had been replaced by a look that spoke
of stern and awful judgment. &#147;Otherwise,&#148;
he began, but paused;
he went on in a cold hard voice, &#147;I was
going to say, I will kill you.&#148;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>XIII<br/>
IN WHICH TWO MEN LEARN OF A<br/>
SISTER&#146;S SACRIFICE</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Jack Bigelow&#146;s</span> usually sunny
face was bleached to the ashiness of
fear and despair. He was so nervous
that he could not keep still a moment
at a time, but would get up and pace
the length of the car, only to return
and look with eyes that attested the
heartache within at the other man,
silent and grim. Taro seemed the
calmer, but well the younger man
knew that beneath that subdued exterior
slumbered a fire that needed but
a breath to be turned into avenging
fury.</p>

<p class="indent">At last they reached their destination.
The little town once again!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>[pg&nbsp;149]</span>
But this night Jack was not alone.
There was no star or moon overhead
to lighten their pathway; a dull, drizzly,
sleety rain was falling. In silence
they left the car; in silence plodded
through the mud of the road and
the damp grass of the field beyond.
The little garden gate creaked on its
hinges as they went through. They
saw the dim outlines of the old palace
before them, with its wide balconies
and sloping roofs. Half-way up the
garden was the family pond, freshened
by a hidden spring, and the little winding
brook which wound hither and
thither showed how it emptied into
the bay beyond. There was even a
tiny boat moored on a toy-like island
in the centre of the pond.</p>

<p class="indent">For the first time Taro Burton paused,
and looked with dreadful eyes at its
dull surface, which even the darkness
of the night and the miserable rain could
not obliterate entirely. What were the
memories that crowded back on him,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>[pg&nbsp;150]</span>
suffocating him? Here it was that
he and Yuki had grown up together.
The little boat was the same, the island
as small and neat, the house seemed as
ever; nothing had changed. Yes, there
was Yuki! A deep groan slipped from
his lips.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a difference of seven years
in their ages, but a stronger bond of
sympathy and comradeship had existed
between these two than is usual between
brother and sister. Their nationality
had to a large extent isolated them
from other children, for the Japanese
children had laughed at their hair
and eyes, and called them &#147;Kirishitans&#148;
(Christians). Until he was seven
years of age, Taro had manfully,
though bitterly, fought his battles
alone. He had been a queer, brooding
little lad, of passionate and violent
temper, and, apparently, scorning any
overtures of friendship from any one
outside his own household.</p>

<p class="indent">When the little sister had come, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>[pg&nbsp;151]</span>
boy had gone suddenly wild with joy,
and had proceeded to bestow upon
her the same worshipful love his mother
gave exclusively to him, for Snowflake
had been born when their English
father lay at the gates of death, her
tiny soul fluttering into life just as
that of her father drifted outward into
eternity, so that to Omatsu, the mother,
who was passionately absorbed in her
grief, her arrival had been a source
of irritation. But Taro had carried
her to the family temple, and had,
himself, named her &#147;Snowflake&#148;
(Yuki), for she had come at a time
when all the land was covered with
whiteness. There had been a frost and
even a snowfall, which is rare in that
part of the country. Moreover, she
resembled a snowflake, so soft and
white and pure.</p>

<p class="indent">How was it possible for him, after all
these years, to come, as he now had
come, once more to this place of which
she had always been a part, and with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>[pg&nbsp;152]</span>
which she had always been lovingly
associated in his mind, and not be filled
with emotions that rent his heart. She
had been his inspiration and all the
world to him.</p>

<p class="indent">He remembered how they would drift
around in their tiny boat, and she,
little autocrat, would perch before him,
her eyes dancing and shining, while
he told her the story of the fisher-boy
Urashima and his bride, the daughter
of the dragon king. And when he
would finish, for the hundredth time,
perhaps, she would say, &#147;See, Taro-sama,
I am the princess, and you the
fisher-boy. We are sailing, sailing,
sailing on the sea &#145;where Summer
never dies,&#146;&#148; and he, to please her
fancy, drifted on and on with her,
around and around the little pond,
until the sun began to sink in the west
and the little mother would call them
in-doors.</p>

<p class="indent">Now the monotonous drip, drip, drip
of the rain-drops as they plashed from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>[pg&nbsp;153]</span>
the weeping willow-trees that surrounded
the tiny lake, fell upon its
dull surface with mournful sound.
Taro groaned again.</p>

<p class="indent">When he had knocked loudly a man
came shuffling round from the rear of
the house, and, in reply to his inquiry
for Madam Omatsu, informed him
gruffly that she had retired.</p>

<p class="indent">It did not matter; he must awaken her,
Taro, who had found voice, told him
with such insistence that the servant
fled ignominiously to obey him. They
waited for some time, out in the melancholy
night. There was no sound
from within the house. Taro hammered
on the door once more. Then
a faint light appeared from a window
close by the door, and the man&#146;s head
showed again. He begged their honorable
patience. He would open in a
fraction of a second. He was very humble
and servile now, and, as he admitted
them, backed before them, bowing
and bobbing at every step, for his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>[pg&nbsp;154]</span>
mistress&#146;s entire household had been
taught to treat foreigners with the
greatest deference and respect.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Go to your mistress,&#148; said Taro,
briefly, &#147;and tell her that her son desires
to see her at once.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">There was immediately a fluttering
at the other side of the shoji. Taro
saw an eye withdraw from a hole.
There were a few minutes of silence,
and then the shoji parted and a woman
entered the room. Her mother-love
must have prompted her to rush into
the arms of her son, for she had not seen
him in five years, but, whatever her
emotions, she skilfully concealed them,
for the paltry reason that her son was
accompanied by a stranger, an honorable
foreign friend; and it behooved
her to affect the finest manners. Consequently
she prostrated herself gracefully,
bowing and bowing, until Taro
strode rapidly over to her and lifted
her to her feet.</p>

<p class="indent">She was quite pretty and very gentle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>[pg&nbsp;155]</span>
and graceful. Her face, oval in contour,
was smooth and unwrinkled as
a girl&#146;s, for Japanese women age slowly.
It was hard to believe she was the
mother of the tall man now holding her
at arm&#146;s length and looking down at
her with such deep, questioning eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Where is my sister, Yuki?&#148; he
demanded, hoarsely.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Yuki?&#148; Madam Omatsu smiled
with saintly confidence. She had retired.
Would they pray wait till morning?
Ah, how was her honorable son,
her august offspring? She began
fondling her boy now, stroking his
face, standing on tiptoe to kiss it,
ecstatically smoothing and caressing
his hands, feeling his strange clothes,
and laughing joyously at their likeness
to those of her dead husband&#146;s.
But the dark shadow on Taro&#146;s face
was deepening, nor would he return
or submit to his mother&#146;s caresses till
his fears regarding his sister were
stilled.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>[pg&nbsp;156]</span>
&#147;Send for her,&#148; he said, briefly, and
she knew he would not be gainsaid.</p>

<p class="indent">Send for her! Ah, Madam Omatsu
begged her noble son&#146;s pardon ten
million times, but she had made a great
mistake. His sister had, of course,
retired, but it was not within their
augustly miserable and honorably unworthy
domicile. She had gone out
on a visit to some friends.</p>

<p class="indent">Taro undid the clinging hands and
pushed her from him, his brooding
eyes glaring.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Where?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Where? Why, it was only a short distance&mdash;perhaps
two rice-fields&#146; lengths
from their house.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;The house?&mdash;the people&#146;s name?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Madam Omatsu whitened a trifle.
Her eyes narrowed, her lips quivered.
She tried once more frantically to prevaricate.</p>

<p class="indent">The people&#146;s name? She could not
quite recall, but the next day&mdash;the
next day surely&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>[pg&nbsp;157]</span>
&#147;Ah-h,&#148; said her son, with delirious
brutality, &#147;you are deceiving me, lying
to me. I demand to know where she is.
I am her rightful guardian. I must
see her at once.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Madam Omatsu protested with faint
vehemence, but she did not weep. She
even essayed a little laugh, that reminded
Jack eerily of Yuki. In the
dimly lighted room she looked strangely
like her daughter, save that she was
much smaller and quite thin and frail,
whereas Yuki was rosy and healthy.</p>

<p class="indent">Taro was speaking to her in Japanese,
in a sharp, cruel voice, and she was
answering gently, meekly, humbly,
consolingly. Jack felt sorry for her.
Suddenly Taro threw her hands from
him, with a gesture of sheer despair
and exhausted patience.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I can learn nothing from her, nothing,&#148;
he said in English. Then he
turned on her again. &#147;Listen,&#148; he
said: &#147;You are my mother, and as
such I honor you, but you must not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>[pg&nbsp;158]</span>
deceive me. I know all; know that
my sister was married to an American;
know how she was married, if you call
such marriage. They do not consider
it so, as you must know. What do you
know of this, my mother? It could not
have happened without your knowledge?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">The mother broke down at last. All
was indeed lost if he knew that much.
She sank in a heap at his feet, and again
the other man was reminded of her
daughter.</p>

<p class="indent">Taro raised her, not ungently, curbing
his emotions.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Pray speak to me the truth,&#148; he
implored.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;It was for you,&#148; she said, faintly, in
Japanese. &#147;I desired it, I, your mother;
and, afterwards, she also, she, your
sister. It was a small sacrifice, my
son.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Sacrifice! What do you mean?&#148;
he cried.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Alas, we had not the money to keep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>[pg&nbsp;159]</span>
you at the American school, and later,
when you desired to return, it was still
harder.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Oh, my God!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">She went on, speaking brokenly in
Japanese. After he had gone to America
their little fortune had been swept
away, but of this they had kept him in
ignorance, fearing that he would not
remain in the university did he know
how poor they had become. The house
belonged to him; they could not sell it.
There had been but poor crops in their
few remaining acres of rice-fields; their
income became smaller and smaller.
One by one their servants and coolies
had to be sacrificed, till there were only
a very few left, and these refused to
be paid for their services. They had
secured money in what manner they
could, and sent it to him. It was hard,
but they loved him.</p>

<p class="indent">Then Yuki, unknown to her mother,
had gone up to Tokyo each day and
learned the arts of the geisha; later
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>[pg&nbsp;160]</span>
she invented dances and songs of her
own, and soon she was able to command
a good price at one of the chief
tea-gardens in Tokyo.</p>

<p class="indent">This for a season had brought them
in a fair income, and for a time they
were enabled to send him even more
than the usual allowance. Then came
his request for his passage money.
Alas! they were but weak and silly
women. They had forgotten to save
against this event in their desire to
keep him in comfort. Nakodas had
approached Yuki, and tempting offers
were made to her. She had resisted
all of them, for she was then below
the age when girls usually marry, but
sixteen years of age. Only when it
became imperative to raise the passage
money would she even listen to the
persuasion of her mother and of the
nakoda. They had pointed out to
her the great advantage, and finally, as
the brother&#146;s letters grew more insistent,
she had broken down and given in.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>[pg&nbsp;161]</span>
After that time she had assisted them in
their efforts to secure her a suitable
husband. They had been exceptionally
successful, for she had married a foreigner
who would likely leave her soon,
which was fortunate in Omatsu&#146;s mind,
one whose excellent virtues and whose
wealth were above question. This was
all there was to tell. She prayed and
besought her honorable son&#146;s pardon.</p>

<p class="indent">During her recital Taro had leaned
towards her, listening with bated breath
to every word that escaped her lips.
His thin, nervous face was horribly
drawn, his hands were clinched tightly
at his side, his whole form was quivering.
He tried to regain his scattered
senses, and his hand vaguely wandered
to his brow, pushing back the thick
black hair that had fallen over it.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You cannot understand,&#148; he said
to the other man, his voice scarcely
recognizable for its labor. &#147;It was
for me, me, my little sister sold herself.
To keep me in comfort and ease!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>[pg&nbsp;162]</span>
Snowflake for me! And they kept me
in ignorance. I did not even dream
they were in straitened circumstances.
Oh, had I not willing hands and an
eager heart to work, to slave for them?
Why should the whole burden have
fallen on her, my little, frail sister? But
it has always been so. There is no
such thing as justice in this land for
the woman.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Jack heard him raving, understood,
and bowed his head in impotent sorrow.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Has your mother given you any
information of her whereabouts?&#148; he
suddenly broke in.</p>

<p class="indent">Taro had forgotten that they were
seeking her. His mother&#146;s story had
held all his attention. The horror
aroused by that recital of devotion,
the thought of the months of her sweet
life which she had sacrificed for him,
and then how he had repulsed her, pressed
on his poor numbed senses. But
Jack&#146;s inquiry recalled him. A thousand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>[pg&nbsp;163]</span>
dark surmises regarding her
overwhelmed him.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Yes, yes&mdash;where is she?&#148; he asked,
huskily.</p>

<p class="indent">She had been with her husband some
days now. Madam Omatsu expected
her home soon, and this time she would
never again return to him.</p>

<p class="indent">Taro&#146;s eyes were inflamed. &#147;And
she has not returned? She should
be here now! Ah, it is plain to be seen
what has happened. She may be taking
her life at this moment. It is what
a Japanese girl would do. She had
the blood of heroes in her veins; she
would not falter.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">All of a sudden he turned upon his
friend. Then the full agony caused
by his sister&#146;s disappearance and her
great sacrifice descended upon him, and
he tottered. Before Jack could stay
him, he swayed forward and, as he fell,
struck his forehead upon the corner of
a heavy chair that had been his father&#146;s.
When Jack raised the head of the unconscious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>[pg&nbsp;164]</span>
man he found blood flowing
from a wide cut over the left eye.</p>

<p class="indent">There were hurrying feet throughout
the house, terrified whispers, and sobs,
and, above all, a mother&#146;s voice raised
in terrible anguish.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>XIV<br/>
A STRUGGLE IN THE NIGHT</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">By</span> day and night they kept their
unrelaxing watch by the bedside of
the sick man. Ever he tossed and
turned and muttered and cried aloud,
one word alone on his lips&mdash;his sister&#146;s
name.</p>

<p class="indent">Tenderly the mother smoothed the
fevered brow, softly she stroked the
restless hands, and tried to still their
fever between her own cool, soothing
ones. Thin lines had traced their
shadows on her worn face; gray threads
had come to mingle with the glossy
black of her hair. But she never permitted
herself, after that first night of
anguish, to betray her emotions, for, if
she did, well she knew she would be refused
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>[pg&nbsp;166]</span>
the precious labor of nursing her
boy. And she kept her sleepless, tireless
watch night and day. Her maid
begged her to lie down herself and rest,
but she shook her head with bright,
dry eyes. Rest for her? While he lay
tossing thus? Nay! perhaps when he
should find the rest, the gods would
permit her also a respite; till then she
must keep her watch.</p>

<p class="indent">She smiled pathetically when the
white-faced American boy tried to insist
that she should sleep, with the little
air of authority he had assumed in
the household. But with the gentle
smile she also shook her head in negation.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Let me take your place,&#148; he pleaded.
&#147;He is dear to me also.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Still she smiled, such a shadowy,
heart-aching smile, and turned back
to the sick-bed.</p>

<p class="indent">Jack Bigelow went back to Tokyo,
and began his vigilant search for the
missing girl. The services of the entire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>[pg&nbsp;167]</span>
metropolitan police board were
called forth, and money was not spared.
The nakoda who had brought about
their marriage was put through a
vigorous catechism, but he could tell
them nothing. The proprietor of the
tea-garden swore she had not returned
to him, and when he bewailed the misfortune
which was filling his house
and gardens with officers, Jack consoled
him by paying liberally for the loss he
claimed he was suffering.</p>

<p class="indent">On the fifth day the mystery of the
girl&#146;s disappearance still remained unsolved.
Large rewards were offered
for a clew to her whereabouts. The
police were sure that she was somewhere
in Tokyo, and Jack urged them
to continue unremitting search in the
city, but each night dawned upon their
fruitless efforts. Now some one had
seen a girl of her description entering
a tea-house on the eve of her disappearance;
another had seen her selling
flowers in the market-place; and yet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>[pg&nbsp;168]</span>
another swore she had gone on board
a German vessel with a dried-up foreigner.
This last person could not
be mistaken&mdash;a Japanese girl with blue
eyes and red hair. But each clew was
found wanting and proved false.</p>

<p class="indent">Then back to Yuki&#146;s home, sick-hearted,
disappointed, weary, went Jack Bigelow.
A servant met him with the
blessed news that the man down with
brain fever was improving; that a
merciful calm had at last come to him,
and that now he slept. Wearied from
his fruitless endeavors to find some clew
to Yuki&#146;s whereabouts, the first good
news in days unnerved the young man.
He sat down, covering his eyes with his
hands. He was badly in need of rest
himself, but his mind was full of the
mother in the sick-room overhead.</p>

<p class="indent">Madam Omatsu, was she resting?</p>

<p class="indent">No, she still kept her watch, but she
was very weak, and they feared she
would break down if they could not
prevail on her to rest.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>[pg&nbsp;169]</span>
Jack went slowly up the stairs, tapped
softly on the shoji, and then entered
the sick-room.</p>

<p class="indent">Taro lay on the heavy English bed,
with its white coverlets and curtains,
his face upturned.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You must rest,&#148; Jack whispered
to the woman with the wan face and
wasted form, kneeling by the bedside.</p>

<p class="indent">She shook her head, resisting.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I beg you to,&#148; pleaded Jack, and,
though she could not understand him,
she knew what he was saying, and
still resisted.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Come,&#148; he said, gently, and put his
hands upon her shoulders. &#147;See, he
sleeps now. It is well, and you will
be too weak and faint to minister to
him when he awakes, otherwise.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">But she protested that her health was
excellent; that she would not leave
her son. He stooped down, and attempted
to raise her gently to her feet,
but she would not permit him.</p>

<p class="indent">He saw the tired droop of the eyes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>[pg&nbsp;170]</span>
&#147;She will fall asleep soon,&#148; he said to
himself, and so sat down beside her,
putting his arm about her and pillowing
her head on his shoulder. She did
not restrain him. She looked gratefully
into the frank, inviting eyes. She
sighed, her head wavered and dropped.
The room was very still and silent.
Gradually the woman fell asleep, and
as she slept she sighed from ineffable
weariness.</p>

<p class="indent">Jack looked towards the silent figure
on the bed. The grayness of the approaching
night gave the face an expression
that was sinister in the extreme.
He shuddered and averted his
face. The little form in his arms grew
heavier.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;She will rest better lying down,&#148;
he thought, and carried her into the
adjoining room and laid her softly
down. Then he took the lighted andon,
and, carrying it into the sick-room, set
it in a corner near the bed, and drew
down the shutters. After this, he went
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>[pg&nbsp;171]</span>
back to the bed, and stood for a minute
looking down on the sleeping man, an
expression of infinite sadness on his
face. Taro stirred, the hand lying outside
the coverlet contracted, then closed
spasmodically; the expression of the
face became terrifying. He moaned.
It seemed to Jack as if the sleeping
man was haunted by a terrible nightmare
which robbed him of the rest that
should have found him.</p>

<p class="indent">And it was with Taro as Jack had
thought. He was in the midst of a fever
dream&mdash;a nightmare. He thought his
little sister, Snowflake, knelt by his
bedside and soothed and ministered to
his wants. He felt rested and at peace
at last; but, alas! just as he was slipping
into happy oblivion a dark form
loomed up beside his sister, bent over,
and clutched at her. She struggled
wildly at first, then weakly; finally her
struggles ceased, and she lay very still
and white. The man lifted her up and
carried her away. After a time he came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>[pg&nbsp;172]</span>
back, and now Taro felt his breath on
his own face. He was bending over
him. In a dim haze he saw the face,
and recognized it as that of his friend,
Jack Bigelow! He tried to reach out
and grasp him, to strike and kill him,
but he was at the mercy of some invisible
power which benumbed him and held
him down. His limbs refused to move,
he was unable to lift so much as a finger,
stir an eyelash, and all the time
the man&#146;s breath was on his face, stealing
into his nostrils and suffocating
him.</p>

<p class="indent">Jack noted the gasping of his friend
with alarm, and stooped over for the
purpose of removing the pillow to give
him relief. But at the touch of his
hand, as he attempted to raise the head
on the pillow, the life blood started
vividly, madly, through the man on
the bed, and suddenly he had sprung
into wild life. Jack saw the terrible
gleam of two delirious eyes, and stood
magnetized. With lightning fury the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>[pg&nbsp;173]</span>
raving man had thrown aside the bedclothes,
sprung from the bed, and thrown
himself on the other with such force
that the two came to the ground together,
the madman on top.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I have you now!&mdash;traitor! betrayer!&#148;
he said, as his hands felt
Jack&#146;s warm throat.</p>

<p class="indent">Jack had been taken so by surprise
that he was dazed in the first moment,
and in the next realized that he was
powerless to defend himself. He was
in the grasp of one temporarily insane,
one whose lithe, physical strength he
already knew well. It would be useless
to fight against that strength. His salvation
lay in being passive and feigning
unconsciousness; but could he do
this with those terrible fingers closing
around his throat, throttling the life
out of him? Now they pressed hard,
now relaxed, now caressed his neck and
throat, rubbed it, pinched only to press
again. He was playing with him!
Jack did not stir. He had closed his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>[pg&nbsp;174]</span>
eyes, and was praying for strength to
meet unflinchingly whatever fate held
for him.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Where have you put her?&#148; came
the fierce whisper, close to his ear.
&#147;Where did you carry her to? Hah!
you are silent. Have I silenced you
like this and this? You are cold; you
cannot breathe now, nor smile nor
laugh at her. No, not while I have
my hand here to press so and so. Once
you were my friend, and I loved you.
But now&mdash;so you killed her! Now I
will kill you like this and this and this!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Jack was becoming weaker and
weaker. The white-shrouded figure
sitting on him leaned forward, staring
dreadfully, but his victim saw nothing,
heard nothing. Suddenly it seemed as
if another had sprung upon him and
was beating his life out. He dimly
heard a woman&#146;s cries, and, intermingled,
a terrible laughter. Then life and
consciousness seemed to depart, and he
knew no more.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>[pg&nbsp;175]</span>
When he regained consciousness he
found himself on a bed. A woman
was leaning over him, bathing his head,
smoothing and caressing it&mdash;a woman
with an angelic face, so like Yuki&#146;s
when she had nursed him during a
brief illness that in his weakness he
fainted at the mere dream of her sweet
presence. But it was not Yuki; it was
the mother. She had been awakened
by the talking and cries in the sickroom,
and, rushing to the door, had
looked in on the terrible scene. Japanese
women have little or no fear of
physical disaster for themselves. She
raised a fearful cry to arouse the household,
then flung herself on the two men,
and with her puny strength sought to
divide them. At first her son laughed
and resisted her, but when her white
face flashed before him his grip grew
weak, and he staggered back, dazed by
the rush of returning reason. He, too,
had taken her for the ghost of his lost
sister!</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>[pg&nbsp;176]</span>
The alarmed household had flocked
into the room. Gently they prevailed
on him to return once more to the bed,
as weak as a child now.</p>

<p class="indent">Jack was not seriously hurt. In his
shattered, nervous condition, however,
the shock had temporarily unhinged
him, and for several days he lay in
bed, waited on and attended by the
gentle Omatsu, who went like a sweet,
soothing spirit back and forth between
the two rooms, who called him &#147;son,&#148;
and was to him as if she were indeed
his mother, till she could not approach
him but he kissed her hands and blessed
her from his heart.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>XV<br/>
THE VOW</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> happy sadness of the brown
autumn had faded in a yellow gleam
of light. December had entered the
land with a little drift of frost and snow
which had surprised the country, for
December is not usually a cold month
in Japan. Its advent shook the little
housewives into action and life. New
mats of rice straw were being laid, and
every nook and corner dusted with fresh
bamboo brooms and dusters, for the
Japanese begin to prepare a month in
advance for the New Year season, and
all the country seems to wake into
active life and present a holiday appearance.</p>

<p class="indent">But the old palace, where dwelt the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>[pg&nbsp;178]</span>
Burton family, kept its garment of
perpetual gloom, and stood out in mocking
contrast to the neighboring houses.
No window was thrown open, no door
turned in to air the place and give it the
sunshine of the coming New Year.</p>

<p class="indent">Thick as the dust that had gathered
about its unkept rooms, the shadow of
death pervaded the place. Vast shadows,
mysterious and oppressive, crept
in, enshrouding it with their ghostly
presence. From afar off the drone of a
curfew bell was heard, its slow, mournful
cadence seeming to drift into a dirge.
Outside the early winds of winter were
wailing a requiem, and all the spirits of
the air floated about and beat against
the sombre palace.</p>

<p class="indent">At dusk consciousness returned to the
dying man, and weakly, though intelligently,
he looked about him, and even
smiled faintly at the wailing and moaning
that crept upward from the rooms
below, where the few old retainers of
the household, who had been in the service
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>[pg&nbsp;179]</span>
of the family long before Taro had
been born, and had stayed by them after
their fortunes had fallen, were huddled
together and loudly lamenting the
approaching death of the son of the
house.</p>

<p class="indent">Before a tiny shrine in a corner of
the room was the prostrate form of the
mother. Her lips were dumb, but her
speaking eyes wailed out her prayer to
all the gods for mercy. And at the
bedside, his face in his hands, knelt
Jack Bigelow. Perhaps he, too, was
praying to the one and only God of his
people.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Burton,&#148; he said, as the sick man
stirred, &#147;you have something to say to
me?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">He bent over and wiped the dews
that lay thick as a frost on lips and
brow.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;My sister&mdash;&#148; Taro began with
painful slowness.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;My wife&mdash;&#148; whispered the other,
his voice breaking, and then, as Taro
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>[pg&nbsp;180]</span>
seemed unable to proceed, he put his
mouth close down to his ear.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Burton, our grief is a common one.
I swear by everything I hold sacred and
holy that I will never cease in my efforts
to find my wife! Nothing that strength
or money can do shall be spared. I
will take no rest till she is found. Before
God, I will right this wrong I have
unconsciously done you and yours&mdash;and
mine!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Taro&#146;s eyes, wide and bright, fixed
Jack&#146;s steadfastly. His long, thin hand
stirred and quivered, and attempted to
raise itself. Without a word Jack took
it in his own. He had understood that
mute effort to mean belief and confidence
in him. And, kneeling there in
the melancholy dusk, he held Taro&#146;s
hand between his own until it was stiff
and cold.</p>

<p class="indent">Whither had the soul of the Eurasian
drifted? Out and along the interminable
and winding journey to the Meido
of his maternal ancestors, or to give
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>[pg&nbsp;181]</span>
an account of itself to the great Man-God-three-in-one-Creator
of his father?</p>
<hr />

<p class="indent">The mother crept from the shrine
with stealing step, her white face like
a mask of death, her small, frail hands
outstretched, like those of one gone blind.</p>

<p class="indent">A consciousness of her eerie approach
thrilled Jack Bigelow. He dropped
Taro&#146;s hand and turned towards her,
standing before and hiding the sight
of the dead from her. In the dim
shadows of the deepening twilight she
looked as frail and ethereal as a wraith,
for she had clothed herself in all the
vestal garments of the dead.</p>

<p class="indent">With somewhat of the heroism of her
feudal ancestors Omatsu had prepared
herself to face and undertake that
perilous journey into the unknown
with her son. In the pitiful tangled
reasoning that had wrestled in the
bosom of this Japanese woman, always
there had disturbed the beauty
of such a sacrifice the doubt as to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>[pg&nbsp;182]</span>
whether the gods would indeed receive
her with this son of hers who had dedicated
his soul to an alien and strange
God. But she had prepared herself
to risk the consequences. And now she
stood there swaying and tottering in
all her ghastly attire, while opposite
to her stood the tall, fair-haired foreigner
with the pitying gray eyes of her own
dead lord.</p>

<p class="indent">She essayed to speak, but her voice
was barely above a parched whisper.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Anata?&#148; (Thou). It was a gentle
word, spoken as a question, as though
she would ask him, &#147;Condescend to
speak your honorable desire with me?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Mother!&#148; he only said&mdash;&#147;dear
mother!&#148;</p>
<hr />

<p class="indent">At Taro&#146;s funeral Jack Bigelow
made the acquaintance of his wife&#146;s
family. He had not imagined it possible
for any one to have so many relatives.
They came from all parts of
the country, distant and close cousins
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>[pg&nbsp;183]</span>
and uncles and aunts, and even an
old grandfather and grandmother, the
former very decrepit and quite blind.
And they all lined up in order, and
wept real or artificial tears and muttered
prayers for the soul of the dead boy.</p>

<p class="indent">A few of them were rich and important
men of high rank in Japan;
some of them were suave and courteous,
coming merely for form&#146;s sake and for
the honor of the family; most of them
were of the type of the decayed gentility
of Japan&mdash;poor but proud, dignified
but humble in their dignity.</p>

<p class="indent">They all regarded Jack with the
same grave, stoical gaze peculiar to
the better-class Japanese, betraying in
no way by their expression surprise or
resentment at his presence among
them. As a matter of fact, none of the
family were aware of the relation in
which he stood to them, and so had
occasion for no real animus against
him, regarding him merely as a friend
of Taro&#146;s. But in his supersensitive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>[pg&nbsp;184]</span>
condition Jack imagined that they looked
upon him as an intruder, perhaps
as one who had brought distress and
havoc upon their household.</p>

<p class="indent">When, however, after the funeral the
little mob of friends and relatives had
gradually dispersed till there was none
left besides himself and Omatsu, the
intense loneliness and silence of the
big house grated upon his nerves, so
that he would have welcomed the wailing
of the servants, which had now
been buried in the grave.</p>

<p class="indent">Omatsu, too, who had borne herself
with heroic fortitude and bravery all
through the day, now that the reaction
had come was shivering and trembling,
and, when he approached her with a
pitying exclamation, she went to him
straightway and cried in his arms
like a little, tired child. He comforted
her with broken words, though his own
tears were falling on her little, bowed
head. And he tried to tell her, in terribly
bad pidgin Japanese&mdash;something
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>[pg&nbsp;185]</span>
Yuki had taught him&mdash;how it
would be his care to protect and guard
her in the future just as if she were
indeed his mother; that he was not
worthy, but he would try to fill the
place of the beautiful boy who was sleeping
his last sleep. And he told of the
promise he had given to Taro, how his
life would be devoted to but one end
and purpose, to find his wife. Would
she accompany him?</p>

<p class="indent">She entreated him to take her with
him. But in the end, after all, she could
not accompany him. Her health, which
had never been robust, gave way to
her grief, and Jack took her back to
her parents, for it was necessary that
he should spare no time from his search,
and, moreover, she was too delicate to
travel. Before leaving her he saw to it
that she and her parents should have
every comfort possible.</p>
<hr />

<p class="indent">The old palace, grim, gray, and
haggard in the winter landscape, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>[pg&nbsp;186]</span>
now completely deserted. The townspeople
looked askance at it, as at a
haunted house, knowing somewhat of
the tragedy that hid within its closed
portals.</p>

<p class="indent">Jack was the last to leave the place.
Omatsu had begged him to see to the
closing up, and the paying-off of all the
old servants. When he had finally come
out he was shocked at the curious crowd
of neighbors who had gathered about the
gates and were whispering and gossiping
about him and waiting for him. But
they were quite respectful and silent
as he passed them. He was an object
of curiosity, this tall foreigner who had
married among them, and they watched
him with round, wondering eyes, following
him all the way to the station,
a little, pygmy procession, very much
as children follow a circus. Once or
twice he half turned as though to tell
them to leave him, but stopped himself
in time, remembering how strange he
must really seem to them.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>[pg&nbsp;187]</span>
At the station he bowed to them gravely,
and his bow was solemnly and politely
returned by those in front. And it
was in this strangely pathetic though
grotesque manner that the tall, fair-haired
barbarian left the town.</p>

<p class="indent">Less than a year before he had been
a light-hearted, joyous boy. He was
now a man, with a burden on his soul
and a sacred task to perform. Moreover,
there was an awful abyss in his
life that must be bridged. Never again
would life have for him the same rosy
bow of promise, not until he had found
that other part of his soul&mdash;his Sun-goddess.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>XVI<br/>
A PILGRIM OF LOVE</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Jack Bigelow</span> went up to Yokohama,
where the Tokyo detectives
thought they had a clew to the girl&#146;s
whereabouts. A new and very beautiful
geisha had appeared among the
dancing-girls, and as no one seemed
to know anything about her history it
was thought that she might be the
missing Yuki. But she had disappeared
only the day before his arrival
there.</p>

<p class="indent">Jack spent a month in the big metropolis,
shadowing the tea-gardens,
and watching, with the assistance of
men he had hired, every geisha house
and garden; but though many girls
apparently answering to the description
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>[pg&nbsp;189]</span>
of Yuki were brought before him, none
of them proved to be the missing girl,
and the disgust the young man experienced
at their total unlikeness to
his wife was only equalled by his bitter
disappointment.</p>

<p class="indent">A telegram from police headquarters
brought him back to Tokyo. Here
he was told that the detectives had
traced the missing girl to Nagasaki,
a seaport on the western coast of Kiushu.
This was the city where Yuki&#146;s father
had first lived in Japan. He had been
the son of a rich silk merchant, and
had come to Japan in order to extend
his knowledge of the silk trade and expand
his father&#146;s business. But Stephen
Burton had become infatuated with the
country, had married a Japanese wife,
assimilated the ways of her people, and
in time had even become a naturalized
citizen. He never returned alive to his
native England, though strange, cold,
red-bearded men had taken his body from
the wife, and had crossed the seas with it.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>[pg&nbsp;190]</span>
Old Sir Stephen Burton had never
forgiven what he considered the <i>m&#233;salliance</i>
of his son, and hence Taro
and Yuki had never seen or known any
of their father&#146;s people, and he himself
had died while they were yet
children.</p>

<p class="indent">Some feeling of sentiment might
have brought Yuki to this place. Moreover,
there were many public tea-houses
there, where she could quickly find employment.
The police were positive in
their statements that they were not
mistaken in the identity of the girl
they claimed to be Yuki.</p>

<p class="indent">Travelling by slow and tedious trains,
with no sleeping accommodations and
but few of the modern luxuries that are
necessities on American trains; travelling
by kurumma, with the flying heels
of his runners scattering the dust of
the highway in his eyes, when the
landscape before, behind, and around
him seemed a maze of dazzling blue;
travelling on foot, when he was too
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>[pg&nbsp;191]</span>
restless to do otherwise than tramp,
he was weary and ill when he finally,
reached Nagasaki. Here an amazing
horde of nakodas pestered him with
their offerings of matrimonial happiness.
He had no heart for them. They
stifled him with memories that were
better sleeping.</p>

<p class="indent">The tea-house to which he had been
directed was owned and run by an
elderly geisha, who, in her day, had
been noted for her own beauty and
cleverness. She was all affectation and
grace now. She met Jack with exaggerated
expressions of welcome, and in
a sweet, sibilant voice pressed upon him
the comforts and entertainments of her
&#147;poor place.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">He did not pause to exchange compliments
with her.</p>

<p class="indent">Was there not in her house a girl,
very beautiful and very young, who
sang and danced?</p>

<p class="indent">Madam Pine-leaf (that was her name)
allowed her face to betray surprised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>[pg&nbsp;192]</span>
amusement at the question. Why, her
place was famous for the beauty of her
maidens, and every one of them danced
and sang more bewitchingly than the
fairies themselves. But she only said,
very humbly:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;My maidens are all unworthily fair,
and all of them indulge in the honorable
dance and song. It is part of the accomplishment
of every geisha.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Yes, but you could not mistake this
girl. She is distinct from all others.
She&mdash;her eyes are blue. She is only
half Japanese!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Ah-h!&mdash;a half-caste.&#148; Madam
Pine-leaf&#146;s lips formed in a <i>moue</i>. She
was very polite, however. She pretended
to consult her mind. Then she
begged that he would remain, at all
events, and see for himself all her girls.</p>

<p class="indent">Impatiently he waited, a terrible
nervousness taking possession of him
at the mere possibility that Yuki might
be near him. But though he scanned
with almost seeming rudeness the faces
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>[pg&nbsp;193]</span>
of the inmates of the place, none of
them was like unto her whom he sought.</p>

<p class="indent">When he paid his hostess, who, recognizing
in him a generous patron,
had been careful to stay close by him
the entire evening, his face betrayed his
exceeding disappointment.</p>

<p class="indent">The woman glanced at the big fee in
her hand, and a feeling of pity and
gratitude called up all her native prevarication.</p>

<p class="indent">Now that she had spent the whole
evening turning the matter over in
her mind, she recalled the fact that only
a few days before a girl answering
exactly to his description of his wife
had worked for her for a short period, but
unfortunately she had left her and gone
to Osaka.</p>

<p class="indent">Madam Pine-leaf&#146;s face was guileless,
her words convincing. There was gentle
compassion in her eyes, which added
to the comfort of her words.</p>

<p class="indent">Jack wrung her slim hands gratefully
till they ached.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>[pg&nbsp;194]</span>
Osaka? How far away was that?
Did Madam Pine-leaf believe he had
time to get there before she would
leave? What was the exact address?</p>

<p class="indent">Yes, she believed he would be in time,
and she drew out a dainty tablet and
wrote an address upon it, and with
deep and graceful obeisances she prayed
that the gods would accompany and
guide him.</p>
<hr />

<p class="indent">He reached Osaka at night, when
its many strange canals and narrow
rivers were reflecting the lights of the
city, like glittering spear-heads, on
their dark, shining surface. The hotel
was miles from the station, but the
streets were deserted, and there was no
traffic to hinder the flying feet of his
runner. At night the city seemed
strangely romantic and peaceful, a
spot that would have attracted one of
Yuki&#146;s temperament. But daylight revealed
it as it was&mdash;a bustling commercial
centre, where everybody seemed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>[pg&nbsp;195]</span>
hurrying as though bent on accomplishing
some important mission.</p>

<p class="indent">Jack stayed but a few days in Osaka.
She was not there. The proprietor
of the Osaka gardens, hearing his
story, humbly apologized for the fact
that while such a girl had honored for
a short season his unworthy gardens,
she had left him now some days ago.
Whither had she gone? To Kyoto.</p>

<p class="indent">And in Kyoto, the most fascinating
and beautiful city in all Japan, he was
sent from one tea-house to another,
each proprietor acknowledging that one
answering to the description had been
in his employ, but declaring that she
had left only a short time previous. She
was only a visiting geisha, who moved
from place to place.</p>

<p class="indent">Finally he traced her back to Tokyo,
the place whence he had started
on his weary pilgrimage. She was
the chief geisha, so he was told, of the
Sanzaeyemon gardens. With his brain
swimming, his lips almost refusing him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>[pg&nbsp;196]</span>
speech, he went straightway to this place.
The proprietor received him with magnificent
humility, and, listening to his
disjointed questions, answered that all
was well. She was even then within
his honorably miserable tea-house. For
the privilege of seeing her he would be
obliged to make an honorably insignificant
charge, and, if he (the august barbarian)
desired to take her away with
him, a further fee must be forthcoming.</p>

<p class="indent">Waiving these questions aside, by
putting down so much coin that the
little proprietor&#146;s eyes matched its glisten,
he followed him up the stairway
to the private quarters of the more important
geishas. Into one of the rooms
he was unceremoniously ushered.</p>

<p class="indent">A girl who sat on a mat put forward
her two hands, and her bowed head on
top of them. Jack watched her with
bated breath. He could not see her
face, and the room was badly lighted.
But when he could bear no longer her
perpetual bowing and had lifted her,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>[pg&nbsp;197]</span>
with hands that shook, to her feet, he
saw her face. It was that of a stranger!</p>

<p class="indent">A slight illness now hindered the
progress of his search, but he would
not allow himself the rest he needed;
and still ill, haggard, and a shadow
of his former self, the young man once
more drifted to the metropolitan police
station.</p>

<p class="indent">They had exhausted all their clews,
but they were kind-hearted little men,
these Japanese policemen. The chief
of police invented a story that would
have done credit to one of Japan&#146;s
poets.</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki was somewhere in the vicinity
of Matsushima Bay, on the northeastern
coast of Japan, near the city of
Sendai, where the waters flow into the
Pacific. This was a spot favored by
unhappy lovers, and the chief of police
had positive evidence that a girl answering
to her description had been seen wandering
daily in that part of the country.
He even produced a telegraph blank,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>[pg&nbsp;198]</span>
with an indecipherable message in Japanese
characters written on it, purporting
to give this information. His advice
to the young man was to go to
this honorable place and stay there for
some time. The country was large
thereabouts. He might not find her at
once, but soon or late surely she would
turn up there.</p>

<p class="indent">Jack was impressed with his glib recital,
and then, moreover, he remembered
that Yuki had told him much
about this place, which they had planned
to visit together some day. He
started straightway for it, buoyed up
with a hope he had not known in
months.</p>

<p class="indent">And the chief of police snapped his
fingers and bobbed his head and clinked
the big fee he had received.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;These foreign devils are na&#239;ve,&#148;
he said to an assistant.</p>

<p class="indent">The cringing assistant agreed.
&#147;They believe any august lie,&#148; he
replied.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>[pg&nbsp;199]</span>
His superior frowned. &#147;It was for
his good, after all,&#148; he returned, tartly.</p>

<p class="indent">In the city of Sendai Jack put up at
a small Japanese hostelry, and from
there each day he would start out and
wander down to the beach of the wonderful bay.
It was all as Yuki had
pictured it, with her vivid, passionate
imagery. There were the countless
rocks of all sizes and forms scattered
in it, with strange, shapely pine-trees
growing up from them, and the one
bare rock called &#147;Hadakajima,&#148; or
&#147;Naked Island,&#148; and all the beautiful
romances, impossible and dreamy as
the fairy tales of a classic Oriental
poet, that she had woven about and
around this place, came back to his mind
now, haunting him like a beautiful
dream, until the memory of her, and
the influence of the beauty of the place,
seemed to cast a mystic spell about
him.</p>

<p class="indent">For, oh! the scenes that enwrapped
the bay! The slopes and hillocks and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>[pg&nbsp;200]</span>
the great mountains beyond were garbed
in vestal white, pure and glistening.
The snowflakes had tipped the branches
of the pine, and there they hung, like
glistening pearl-drops, sometimes dropping
with little bounds on the rocks,
there to freeze or melt into the bay.</p>

<p class="indent">And some vague fancy, baffling in
its hopelessness, nevertheless, clung
to him that possibly she might have
come hither to this peaceful spot, far
from the scenes where they had loved
and suffered so deeply, for, with unerring
insight, Jack knew that she
had loved him. Bit by bit he traced
backward in his mind every proof
she had given him of this, and now,
when the sorrow of her loss seemed
more than he could bear, the knowledge
of this upheld and cheered him always.</p>

<p class="indent">But the beauty of Matsushima could
give him no peace of mind or soul, for
he was alone! The stillness and silence
of the very atmosphere, the tall
pine-trees, bending gracefully in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>[pg&nbsp;201]</span>
swaying, swinging breezes, seemed to
mock him with their calm content. The
bay was enchanted&mdash;yes, but haunted
too&mdash;haunted by the imagination of
the little feet that had perhaps wandered
along its shore.</p>

<p class="indent">In a little village only a short distance
from the beach, inhabited by a
few simple, honest fisher-folk, Jack
tried to ascertain whether they had
seen aught of her he sought. But
they babbled fairy stories back at him.
There had been many, many witch-maids
who had haunted the shores of
Matsushima; many young girls, who
had lost their minds through unfortunate
love affairs, had wandered thither.
They were the ghosts of these unfortunate
lovers, who had sought in death
the bliss of love denied them in life,
which now haunted the shore of the bay.</p>

<p class="indent">That the strange, fair man who had
lost his bride would meet the same
untimely though poetic fate the simple
people never doubted.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>[pg&nbsp;202]</span>
And so, like one who has lost his
soul, he wandered hither and thither
throughout the islands of Japan in
search of it.</p>

<p class="indent">Sunshine had been the dominant
element in Jack Bigelow&#146;s character,
and in a less degree impulsiveness and
generosity. No one had ever given
him credit for intensity of feeling or
greatness of purpose. But sometimes
tribulation will bring out such qualities,
which have lain hidden beneath
an apparently superficial exterior.</p>

<p class="indent">A deep, abiding love for his summer
bride had sprung into eternal life in
his heart. She was never absent from
his mind. There were moments when
for a time he would forget his immeasurable
loss, and would drift into memory,
and in fancy re-live with her that
dream summer. She had become the
soul of him. She would remain in
his heart until it ceased to beat.</p>

YUKI&#146;S WANDERINGS</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Had</span> Jack followed Yuki on the
night she went out of his house and
life, he would have known that she
was not to be found in all Japan. She
had hurried from his and Taro&#146;s
presence with but one object&mdash;to take
herself forever from the sight of the
brother whom she had loved but who
had repulsed her, whom she had dishonored
in trying to assist. She took
the road for Tokyo, and, head downward,
sobbing like a little child who
has lost its way in the dark, stumbled
blindly along until she had come within
its limits.</p>

<p class="indent">She had no idea whither she was going
now, what she would do; her mind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>[pg&nbsp;204]</span>
could only contain her grief. But as
she wandered aimlessly about, weeping
silently, an address slipped itself into
her consciousness&mdash;the address written
on the card handed her by the American
theatrical man months before, when he
had followed her from the tea-house.
She had studied the card curiously at
the time, and now, though the name
had escaped her&mdash;she had really never
been able to make it out&mdash;her mind
still held the address.</p>

<p class="indent">She turned in the direction in which
she knew the American&#146;s house lay,
and at length found it, wearied both
by the anguish of her mind and by
her long walk. Yes, the American
gentleman was in, said the garrulous
Japanese servant who answered her
timid summons. He had returned from
lands far south less than a week ago,
and now in two more days he would be
off again. Did she want to meet him?
Perhaps he slept.</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki said she would speak with him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>[pg&nbsp;205]</span>
but a minute, and the servant vanished.
Almost immediately the manager
appeared before her, frowning heavily.
But at sight of her his face
brightened wonderfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Why, if it ain&#146;t the girl I heard sing
at the tea-garden!&#148; he cried. &#147;Come
right inside.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">And he eagerly drew her, unresisting,
within.</p>
<hr />

<p class="indent">Two days later, on board the <i>Yokohama
Maru</i>, Yuki left her native Japan.</p>

<p class="indent">As the ship weighed anchor, she
closed her eyes and faintly clung to
the guard-rail. All about her she could
hear the passengers talking and laughing,
a few were cheering and waving
flags and handkerchiefs to friends on
shore. And long after the wharf was
only a dim, shadowy outline she still
clung there to the rail, her hands cold
and tense.</p>

<p class="indent">Some one put an arm about her, and she
started as though she had been struck.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>[pg&nbsp;206]</span>
&#147;You are not ill already, you poor
little thing?&#148; said a woman&#146;s clear,
pleasing voice.</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki regarded her piteously. She
dimly recognized in her the wife of her
employer, and she struggled to regain
her scattered wits, but vainly. She
was only able to look up into the sympathetic
face of the other with eyes
which could not conceal the turbulent
tragedy of her soul.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Why, you are shivering all over, and
are as cold as&mdash;Jimmy, come over
here,&#148; she turned and called peremptorily
to her husband, who hastened
forward, throwing his cigar overboard.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Look here; she&#146;s sick already. Better
send one of those ayah women, or
whatever you call &#145;em, over, and have
her put to bed right away.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">They undressed her, submissive as a
little child, and put her into the berth
of a little stateroom, which seemed to
Yuki, who had never in her life before
been on board a vessel of any sort, save
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>[pg&nbsp;207]</span>
the tiny craft about the rivers at her
home, like a tiny cage or vault, wherein
she, exhausted and weary, had been put
to die.</p>

<p class="indent">She lay there with the surging bustle
of the ship&#146;s noises overhead and the
tremulous growl of the waters beneath
the ship droning in her ears like the
melancholy ringing of a dying curfew-bell
at twilight.</p>

<p class="indent">The ayah reported to the manager&#146;s
wife, an ex-comic-opera prima donna,
that she was resting and sleeping; but
when that impetuous, big-hearted woman
peeped in on her, she found Yuki&#146;s
eyes wide open. She whirled into the
small stateroom, almost filling it with
her large person, and sat down beside
the poor little weary girl and looked at
her with friendly and approving eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You are like a pretty picture on a
fan,&#148; she said; &#147;the prettiest Japanese
girl I&#146;ve seen. I think we&#146;ll be fine
friends, don&#146;t you?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki could only assent with a weary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>[pg&nbsp;208]</span>
little nod of her head. She closed her
eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You are not so dreadfully sick, are
you?&#148; said the American. &#147;I thought
maybe we could have a nice little gossip
together. You see, my husband&#146;s
the boss of this whole outfit that we&#146;ve
got along with us, and I don&#146;t know
that there&#146;s one of the whole lot I&#146;ve
ever cared to associate with before.
You&#146;re different. Now, ain&#146;t I good
to speak out just what&#146;s on my mind,
eh?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I <i>ought</i> to thang you,&#148; said Yuki,
feebly, &#147;but I am too weary to be perlite.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Then you shall be left alone, you
child, you,&#148; said the other; then she
kissed Yuki lightly, and went out of
the door.</p>

<p class="indent">But after she had gone Yuki&#146;s passivity
left her. She sat up quivering,
and then with nervous quickness she
began to dress herself. She could not
open the door of the stateroom. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>[pg&nbsp;209]</span>
was unused to strange doors that required
the pushing of springs and bolts.
She had lived in a land where bolts and
locks were almost unknown, where a
shoji fell apart at a touch of a hand.
Now she pushed hard against the door,
but, as she had not turned the handle,
it refused to move. A terror possessed
her that they had locked her in this
tiny, awful cell, to which penetrated no
light save that which filtered through
a small porthole against which the waters
beat and beat.</p>

<p class="indent">She flung herself desperately against
the door, battering it with her tiny
hands; she felt herself growing dizzy
and blind as the ship rocked and swayed
beneath her feet. She tried to pace
the tiny length of the stateroom, her
sense of terrible loneliness and homesickness
deepening with every moment.
The moving of the ship horrified her,
and the knowledge that it was taking
her farther and farther from her home
across the immense bottomless sea filled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>[pg&nbsp;210]</span>
her with a terror akin to nothing She
had ever known in her life before.</p>

<p class="indent">In the sickening, wearying dazzle of
the few days previous to their sailing,
the girl&#146;s mind had held but one thought&mdash;to
go far away from the scenes of her
pain; now perhaps the reaction had
come, and her terror at the step she
had taken appalled her. Memory, which
had been thrust out of sight by the ever-present
nagging pain that had blinded
her to all else, now asserted its power,
merciless and invincible. She pressed
her hands to her head, as though to
blot out forever from her mind the pitiless
ghosts that haunted her.</p>

<p class="indent">Like the wraiths that come and vanish
in a nightmare, the events of her
life came to her one by one&mdash;the happy
childhood with her brother, their passionate
devotion to each other, her grief
at his departure for America, the months
of struggle that had followed, sacrifices
made for him, her attempts to make a
living sufficient for his maintenance in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>[pg&nbsp;211]</span>
America, and then&mdash;her marriage! After
that, memory held no other thought but
the immeasurable craving and longing
that was almost madness for the voice,
the touch, the sight of the man she had
loved and left.</p>

<p class="indent">It was three days before her illness
ended. Then, having begged the consent
of the woman who attended her,
she crept up the companion-way and
out on deck, where the passengers were
disporting and enjoying themselves.</p>

<p class="indent">She had looked forward to the time
when she would regain sufficient
strength to leave her prison-cell, for
such she regarded her stateroom. In
the strange medley of ideas which had
curiously woven themselves into a maze
in her mind, she had imagined that
once in the open on deck she would see
once more the shores of her home, Fujiyama&#146;s
lofty peak smiling against its celestial
background, and hanging like a
mirage in mid-air.</p>

<p class="indent">But there was no sight visible to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>[pg&nbsp;212]</span>
her, as, with her hand shading her eyes,
she looked out before her, save a vast,
cold, pitiless waste of surging waters,
jumping up to meet the sky, which
smiled or glowered with its moods.</p>
<hr />

<p class="indent">In the months that followed, Yuki
met with nothing but kindness from
the American theatrical manager and
his wife. With them she went to
China, India, the Philippines, and
finally to Australia. From all these
different points the American theatrical
scout drew together a motley troupe
of jugglers, fancy dancers, wizards,
fencers, and performers of one sort and
another, with which he hoped to make
a larger fortune in America. He had
combined business with this long pleasure
trip, for he was on his bridal tour
at the time.</p>

<p class="indent">By some remarkable intuition peculiar
sometimes to the gayest and most
frivolous hearted of women of the world,
the wife of the theatrical manager had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>[pg&nbsp;213]</span>
gained some insight into the cause of
the pitiful sensitiveness and shrinking
shyness of the queer little Japanese girl
with the blue eyes, to whom she had
taken an extravagant fancy.</p>

<p class="indent">She had taken Yuki under her personal
charge, and sheltered and shielded
the girl from the overbold scrutiny
of those with whom they daily came
in contact. It was many months, however,
before she learned her history. In
fact, it was only a few days before their
expected departure for America, the
great country in the west, which seemed
to Yuki as far distant as the stars
above her.</p>

<p class="indent">As the time for their departure, which
had been delayed already much longer
than the manager had anticipated,
drew nearer, Yuki grew more depressed
and restless, so that to the exaggerated
fancy of the American woman she
seemed to be fading away and entering
into what she emphatically called
&#147;the last stages of consumption.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>[pg&nbsp;214]</span>
She cornered the girl relentlessly, and
finally wrung from her the whole pitiful,
tragic story of her life. How homesick
and weary she had been ever since
she had left Japan, how her heart seemed
to faint whenever she thought of that
final interview with her brother, and
of the immeasurable longing for the
man she loved, and whom she had
married &#147;for jus&#146; liddle bid while.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">All the big, romantic heart of the
American woman went out to her as
she took her into her arms and mingled
her own honest tears with Yuki&#146;s.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You sha&#146;n&#146;t go to America,&#148; she
said, drying her eyes with a tiny piece
of lace which served as a handkerchief.
&#147;You are going right back to Japan,
bag and baggage of you. I&#146;m going
with you, to see you get there O.K.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Bud&mdash;&#148; began Yuki, weakly.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Never mind, now. I know he expects
to sail in a week. I don&#146;t. I&#146;m
boss! See!&#148;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>XVIII<br/>
THE SEASON OF THE CHERRY<br/>
BLOSSOM</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">In</span> summer the fields of Japan are
alive with color&mdash;burning flat lowlands
shimmering with the dazzling
gleam of the natane and azalea blossoms.
In autumn the leaves, as well
as the blossoms, have caught all the
tints of heaven and earth, and in winter
the gods are said to be resting after
their riotous ramblings during the
warm months. But in the spring-time
they awake, and in their lavish
renewed youth bless hill and dale and
meadow and forest with an abandon
unlike any other time of year. It is
the season of the cherry blossom, of
the mating of the birds, the babbling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216"></a>[pg&nbsp;216]</span>
of the brooks, and the chattering and
unfolding anew of all the beauties of
nature.</p>

<p class="indent">It was two years from the day when
Jack and Yuki had married each other
in the spring-time. And Jack was
back in Tokyo. Recalled thither by a
telegram from the police headquarters,
he was preparing to depart for America,
where the police claimed they had
positive evidence that Yuki had gone.
He was staying at an American hotel
in the city proper, and his heart on
this day sickened and yearned for the
little house only a few miles away that
he longed and yet dreaded to see again.</p>

<p class="indent">Now that he contemplated leaving
Japan, the dread possibility that Yuki
might still be in the country and that
he would be placing the distance of
thousands and thousands of miles
of land and water between them, depressed
and weighed on his mind, despite
the really plausible proof the police
board had that she had gone to America
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217"></a>[pg&nbsp;217]</span>
with a theatrical company&mdash;that of the
very man he himself had witnessed
coaxing her to go with him.</p>

<p class="indent">The afternoon previous to the day
set for sailing, his melancholy and
morbidness grew in intensity. With no
fixed purpose in view he started out
from his hotel, tramped half-way across
Tokyo, then hailed a jinrikisha and
gave the runner orders to take him
to the little house that had formerly
been his home, and which he had struggled
against visiting ever since his return
to Tokyo.</p>

<p class="indent">As in a dream the interminable stretch
of rice-fields, blue mountains, and valleys
and hamlets, stretching away into misty
outlines, flashed by him, and he noted
only half absently how the heels of
his runner were all worn hard just
as if they had dried in the sun.
Yuki once had called his attention to
this.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;The honorable soles are the same,&#148;
she had said. &#147;It is the perpetual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>[pg&nbsp;218]</span>
running. The gods have mercifully
protected the feet from pain.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">The landscape about him, familiar
as the face of a mother, gave him no
pain now. He was conscious only of
a sense of ineffable rest and peace, as a
traveller who has wandered long feels
when nearing home. And soon the
runner had stopped with a jerk, and
was doubling over and waiting for
his pay.</p>

<p class="indent">Should he humbly wait for his excellency
to condescend to return to the
city?</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Just for a little while,&#148; Jack told
him absently. And he went through
the little garden gate and up the pebbled
adobe path, now arched on either side
by two rows of cherry-blossom trees,
that met at the top and made a bower
under which to walk.</p>

<p class="indent">When he had pushed the door backward
and stepped inside he paused
irresolute, his heart paining him with
its rapid beating. Coming from out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219"></a>[pg&nbsp;219]</span>
the blaze of the out-door light into the
shadowed room, his vision dazzled him.
But gradually the objects inside grew
upon his consciousness, and a rosy pain,
an ecstasy that stung him with its
sweetness, shot upward like a dawn
through all his being.</p>

<p class="indent">He scarcely dared breathe, so potent
was the influence of the place upon him.
He feared to stir, lest the spell, ghostly
and entrancing as the influence of a
magic hand, might vanish into mistland,
for with all the immeasurable pain
that rushed to his heart in a flame was
mingled a tentative, exquisite pleasure&mdash;a
survival of the old joy he had once
known.</p>

<p class="indent">And there came back to his mind
whisperings of the old mysterious romances
she had been wont to ramble
into. What was that tale of the spirit
which haunted and was felt but never
seen? Was there not behind it all some
mysterious possibility of such a spirit?
For the very furnishings of the room,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>[pg&nbsp;220]</span>
the mats, the vases, the old broken-down
hammock, and his big tobacco-bon,
each and all of them suddenly
assumed a personality&mdash;the personality
of one he loved.</p>

<p class="indent">Stepping on tip-toe, he crossed the
room and stooped to touch the little
drum, the sticks of which were snapped
in twain. And then he suddenly remembered
how she had broken them
because he had complained one day
that her drum disturbed him. He had
liked the koto and the samisen; the
drum she had beaten on when she
mocked him. Now the sight of it beat
against his brain and heart.</p>

<p class="indent">He could not bear the sight of those
little broken sticks. He tried to cover
them with his handkerchief, as if they
were the evidence of a crime.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;The place is haunted!&#148; he said, and
scarce knew his own hollow voice,
which the echoes of the silent room
mocked back at him.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I shall go mad,&#148; he said, and again
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>[pg&nbsp;221]</span>
the echoes repeated, &#147;Mad! mad!
mad!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Then he covered his eyes, and sat
in the silence, motionless and still.</p>
<hr />

<p class="indent">From afar off there came to him the
melancholy sweetness of the bells of a
neighboring temple. They caused his
hearing exquisite pain. What memories
were recalled by them! But now
every toll of the bells, slow and muffled,
seemed to speak of baffled hope
and despair. There was no balm in
their sweet monotone. Would they
never cease? Why were they so loud?
They had not been so formerly. Now
they filled all the land with their ringing.
What were they tolling for, and,
ah, why had the ghostly visitants of
his house caught up the tone, and
softly, sweetly, with piercing cadence,
chanted back and echoed the sighing
of the bells?</p>

<p class="indent">The house was full of music, inexpressibly
dear and familiar. He started
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>[pg&nbsp;222]</span>
to his feet, trembling like one afflicted
with ague. And gradually words, in
a fairy language that he had learned
to love, began to form themselves into
the melody of a voice.</p>

<p class="indent">Slowly, painfully, like one led by unseen,
subtle, persuasive hands, he went
forward, and up and up the spiral
stairs till he had reached her chamber,
and there he stood, like one who has
come far and can go no farther.</p>

<p class="indent">One other presence besides himself
was within. This he knew, and still
could not comprehend. He could see
her plainly, just as she had been in
life&mdash;her little, shining head, her dear,
small hands, the long, blue, misty eyes,
and the small mouth with the little
pathetic droop that had come to it in
the last few days they had been together.
She stood with her hands
raised, dreamily loitering before a mirror,
putting cherry blossoms in her hair
on either side of her head. But at the
prolonged silence that ensued she turned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>[pg&nbsp;223]</span>
slowly about, and then she saw the
man standing silently in the doorway.</p>

<p class="indent">She was not a girl to scream or faint,
but she went gray with fear, and stood
perfectly still there in the middle of the
room. Then gradually her eyes travelled
upward to the man&#146;s face, and
there they remained transfixed.</p>

<p class="indent">For a long while they faced each other
thus, both with hearts that seemed
not to beat. Then the man made a
movement towards her, a passionate,
wild movement, and she had dropped
the flowers from her hands, and had
gone to meet him. The next moment
he was crushing her to him. When he
released her but a moment, it was to
hold her again and yet again, as though
he feared to find her gone, and his arms
empty once more, as they had been for
so long. He could only breathe her
name&mdash;&#147;Yuki! Yuki! My wife! My
wife!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Neither tried to explain. There was
time enough for that. They were absorbed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>[pg&nbsp;224]</span>
alone in the fact that they were
together at last.</p>

<p class="indent">Some one noisily entered the house
and whirled up the stairs. It was the
American girl. She gazed in upon
them with eyes and mouth agape in
amazement.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Well, I never!&#148; she ejaculated, and
went out and down the steps, sobbing
aloud.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Such a romance! Such a nice, big
fellow, too! And, oh, dear me, I&#146;ve lost
her sure enough now forever! Bother
men, anyhow!&#148; and she jumped into
Jack&#146;s jinrikisha and bade the man
take her on the instant to Tokyo.</p>
<hr />

<p class="indent">Meanwhile the lovers had wandered
out into the open air. He was holding
both her hands in his, and his eyes were
straying hungrily over her face; her
eyes bewitched him; her lips thrilled
him.</p>

<p class="indent">The thousand petals of cherry blossoms
were falling about them, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>[pg&nbsp;225]</span>
birds had all flown to their garden and
were twittering and bursting their little
throats with melody. A fugitive wind
came up from the bay and tossed the
little scattering curls about her ears
and temples. A strand of her hair
swept across his hand. He stooped and
kissed it reverently, and she laughed
and thrilled under the touch of his
lips.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I love you with all my soul,&#148; he said.
&#147;Do not laugh at me now.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">She said, &#147;Dear my lord, I will never
laugh more ad you. I laugh only for
the joy ad being with you.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I will take you to my home,&#148; he
said.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I will follow you to the end of the
world and beyond,&#148; said she.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;And we will come back here again,
love. We will take up the broken
threads of our lives and piece them
together.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;They shall never again be broken,&#148;
she said. But he must needs spoil
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>[pg&nbsp;226]</span>
her divine faith. &#147;Till death do us
part,&#148; he added.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;No, no. We will have the faith of
our simple peasant folk. We are wedded
for ever an&#146; ever.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Yes, forever,&#148; he repeated.</p>
